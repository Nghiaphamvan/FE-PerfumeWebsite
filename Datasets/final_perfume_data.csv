Tihota Eau de Parfum,1043,Indult," Rapa Nui for sugar, Tihota is, quite simply, The One. The One that will call to you every moment you're not smelling it, The One that you've only had hints of in other vanilla perfumes, The One that lasts and lasts, The One that has perfectly captured the essence of the pure nature of fresh vanilla beans and has harnessed it beyond your wildest dreams. It inspires obsessive devotion with its fragrance of smooth, vanilla bean pods dipped in honeyed water and left to steep. The result is the pure magic, an unbridled vanilla, sweet, raw and achingly desirable. Of course, Tihota isn't the first perfume to focus on the dark sweetness of vanilla... perfumery is filled with vanillas, but this smells like the dream of a master perfumer who was obsessed with vanilla and was finally given free rein to worship the note with no apologies. It is, without a sliver of a doubt, the finest pure vanilla we've ever had the honor of carrying, and it's so beautiful it pains us to put the bottle down."," Vanilla bean, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sola Parfum,1934,Di Ser," A tribute to the expanse of space extending from the sky to the flower and fruit laden earth below, Sola, the newest offering from DI SER and perfumer Yasuyuki Shinohara, showcases the natural flora of Hokkaido, Japan with locally sourced and sustainably harvested ingredients from DI SERs own gardens. Starting with aromatic notes of freshly harvested Hokkaido lavender, lemongrass and yuzu, the uplifting scent moves to a floral middle of Japanese rose, magnolia, geranium and jasmine before settling on a spiritual bed of frankincense and myrrh. The spiritual and meditative scent evokes an imagery of a peaceful universe in complete harmony with the bounties of nature and of peace and contentment with its generous offerings."," Lavender, Yuzu, Lemongrass, Magnolia, Geranium, Jasmine, Frankincense, Myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/788011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kagiroi Parfum,2953,Di Ser," An aromatic ode to the ancient beauty of Japan, Kagiroi represents the changes in the shade of the dawn sky over the mountains of Hokkaido, Japan. As the dawn sky transitions through shades of purple, yellow, orange and red, this scent that showcases many ingredients used for the first time in perfumery transitions from an aromatic slightly spicy top to an earthy and woody base, representing the ebb and flow in the stages of life. The perfume opens with notes of Japanese herbs and citruses, moves to a slightly floral spicy middle and settles into a deep woody base accentuated by the use of the Hinoki cedar that dot the mountain landscapes. A deeply personal and spiritual scent, Kagiroi is a scent of shifting aromatic complexities representing transitions in the journey of life.Parfum Edition: We are honored and delighted to offer the rare and precious Parfum edition of Kagiroi, which adds to the composition a precious specimen of Japanese agarwood, which adds rich, spiritual dimensionality and a truly impressive and long-lasting drydown to this already complex and wonderful scent."," Green yuzu, green shikuwasa, sansho seed, coriander, ylang-ylang, shiso, rosewood, vetiver, hinoki, cypriol, patchouli, agarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/788012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Velvet Fantasy Eau de Parfum,2306,Montale," Velvet Fantasy is a solar fragrance where citrus and velvety fruits mingle with the elegance of rose and the gourmand femininity of violet. Thereafter, incense unveils amber and white musk to create a bewitching and wild dance. What We Think A sweet and fruity fragrance with a rich long lasting warmth. Like a decadent dessert, it starts off bringing together the bright freshness of the tangerine with some sweet berry and apple notes and the creaminess of the toffee and vanilla. The fragrance smoothly transitions into a deliciously bold blend of amber, leather, sweet vanilla and creamy woods. Absolutely mouthwatering."," tangerine,  pink pepper,  black coffee,  leather,  violet,  jasmine,  lily of the valley,  heliotrope powder,  vanilla,  amber, sandalwood,  toffee,  musk,  oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
A Blvd. Called Sunset Eau de Parfum,1086,A Lab on Fire," There's no way A Lab On Fire could relocate to Los Angeles and not pay tribute to L.A.'s most iconic Boulevard, home to the legendary neon-drenched rock stages of the Strip, the crashing waves of the Palisades, and everything in between. The result is A Blvd. Called Sunset, a bright, fresh, just the right amount of edgy journey across our wild and beautiful city. Bright, fresh bergamot sparkles in a smooth, salty, almond-inflected breeze, while a masculine leaning-floral blend of violet and jasmine combines with a leather that evokes the biker bars and metal clubs so famously captured in Ed Ruscha's seminal photo book. A smooth, intoxicating base of sandalwood, vanilla, and tonka goes down like a perfect mixed drink, comforting and sensual all at once. If you ever get a chance to take a trip down Sunset, there's nothing like it in the world. But the next best thing is a day spent wearing A Blvd. Called Sunset- a perfect tribute to the heart and soul of Los Angeles."," Bergamot, almond, violet, jasmine, leather, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56719.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Freckled and Beautiful Eau de Parfum,1848,A Lab on Fire," There's no beauty quite like being young in the City of Angels- the wind in your hair, the sand between your toes, the endless possibilities for freedom and adventure in a sun-dappled, ocean-kissed paradise where the days never end and anything is possible. Freckled and Beautiful is a perfect tribute to the beauty of youth in L.A., a warm and hazy beachside floral with an unforgettable gourmand touch. It's a fragrance that highlights everything that makes A Lab On Fire Great- creamy, romantic orange blossom, the unmistakable tang of salty ocean air, and a mouthwatering and unique gourmand component- in this case, a warm milk and Petit-Beurre pastry accord that comforts and nourishes like the perfect after-school snack. Delicious and delightful, Freckled and Beautiful captures the unique jubilation of youth, and is a must-try for all lovers of A Lab on Fire's gift for floral gourmands."," Orange flower, neroli, honeysuckle, warm milk, pastry, salicylates, sandalwood, vanilla bean, heliotrope",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56720.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Exit the King Eau de Parfum,2469,Etat Libre d'Orange," In these tumultuous times, a fragrance that celebrates destruction and dethronement might seem... risky. But Etat Libre was never about playing it safe, and Exit The King, like all their best releases, is risky in all the best ways, a you've-never-smelled-anything-quite-like-this fragrance that tears down the contours of a classical chypre to uncover a blindingly fresh, delightfully sexy new regime. An immaculate blend of contrasts: electrically overdosed florals, sparkling fresh soap foam, and the sharp green of tree moss, all set against a woodsy, milky blend of patchouli and sandalwood. It's both comfortably familiar, but thrillingly new- a modern, stylish floral that's both everyday perfect, and secret weapon good."," Timur JE, Soap Foam Accord (Aldehydes & Musk), Pink Pepper, Jasmine e-pure, Rose Superessence, Lily-of-the-valley Accord, Patchouli, Moss Absolute, Sandalwood Accord & Orcanox",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/477053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eshu Extrait,2031,PRIN," Eshu, the mischievous god of Yoruba legend, who translates between the gods and all the peoples of earth. Eshu, a groundbreaking 2000 Fall/Autumn collection from the late Alexander McQueen, which inspired Prin Lomros to create this scent. Eshu, the fragrance, a universally fluent dialogue between rich, earthy tobacco, fiery spices, sweet cognac, and touches of animalics, woods, and musk. The synthesis is surprisingly smooth, a powerful yet utterly wearable boozy tobacco with intense, sophisticated resin and spice tones, distinctive and unforgettable. An ingenious juxtaposition of traditional tribal elements and modern twists, Eshu is not to be missed."," Tobacco, hay, elemi, copaiba, olibanum, nutmeg, black pepper, castoreum, atlas cedar, oakmoss, cognac, ambroxan, norlimbanol, cinnamon, cumin seed, ash",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Saringkarn Extrait,2481,PRIN," A taste of love and seduction. The value of love between lover, friend and family and humanity. A taste of happiness. Saringkarn, a tribute to the traditional and ancient Thai form of literary composition, is a tantalizing and unique scent somewhere between gourmand, floral, and oriental, where dark and sensual tones of oud, amber, leather, and tobacco gain an alluring, romantic sweetness from beeswax, dark chocolate, and a bouquet of exquisite roses. Sweet, boozy prune gives a cognac-like richness, while a darker smoke note preserves just the right amount of provocative danger. Like any true work of literary genius, it's up to you how to interpret it all."," Saffron, champaca, fir balsam, beeswax, amber, damask rose, rose de mai, tobacco, leather, dark chocolate, prune, oud, musk, oakmoss, ambrette, smoke, incense, ylang ylang",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Arsalan Parfum,2324,PRIN," The Persian legend of Arsalan is a story of a royal heir who rediscovers his hidden heritage and decides to reclaim his throne. And as would befit a fragrance based on hidden power, Arsalan is a gorgeous and richly textured floral spice scent that feels warm, lush, and romantic, but also reveals an intensely potent blend of some of the finest Southeast Asian ouds available. Beneath a bright, alluring bouquet of luscious, smooth champaca and jasmine, an intense and carnal rush of Cambodian oud and Thai Trat oud displays a multifaceted profile of sweet, warm, sensual oud tones. A bright, sparkling olibanum incense plays off of an exotic spice blend, uplifting and giving sophisticated complexity. Arsalan the prince needed a long journey before he was able to reveal his nobility, but Arsalan the fragrance is undeniably, wonderfully regal."," Cambodian oud, Trat oud, jasmin sambac, champaca, olibanum, turmeric, clove, caraway, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, gardenia, opoponax, saffron, sandalwood, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nocturnal Poetry Parfum,1144,PRIN," Who says a nightmare needs to be a bad experience? In the talented imagination of Prin Lomros, the surreal feeling that accompanies an unsettling dream is sublime inspiration. This sensation is captured to enchanting effect in Nocturnal Poetry, a lush, intoxicating floral with the spicy, animalic complexity that PRIN is known for. A cool, green and thorny bouquet of violet, champaca, and rose sits in a misty fog of incense and myrrh, kissed with sweet, earthy notes of beeswax, hay, and coffee. A dark base of oud, animalics and leather beckons with provocative mystery, but Lomros always keeps Nocturnal Poetry from becoming too unsettling- ultimately, this dreamlike floral is a journey anyone will enjoy taking."," Violet, champaca, rosewood, beeswax, frankincense, myrrh, coffee bean, rose, tobacco, hay, jasmine, leather, castoreum, hyrax, civet, musk, oud, turmeric, cumin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Homa Parfum,1374,PRIN," Sanskrit for a sacred Hindu fire ritual, Homa is a sumptuously complex blend of spices, florals, and animalics to elevate both spirit and consciousness. Using fire as the direct messenger between humans and gods, Homa transmutes these exotic ingredients into something simultaneously rich and earthy, but also transcendent and ethereal, weaving threads of smoke, ash, ozone and incense into the fragrant blend to represent the journey of these sacred offerings into the realm of the spirits. There's more than enough sophistication to satisfy lovers of Prin's deepest, most animalic elixirs- dark oud, earthy mushroom, and (natural, cruelty-free) fossilized hyrax and goat hair lend primal intensity, but Homa is balanced with bright, sparkling airiness that make it wonderfully wearable. For those looking to commune with the heavens, Homa is a sacred ritual safe to perform anytime."," Cinnamon, ginger, black pepper, cardamom, cassia, cumin, turmeric, caraway, nutmeg, clove, saffron, hay, kaffir lime, oud, galbanum, ghee butter, jasmine, champaca, tuberose, beeswax, incense, myrrh, spikenard, costus, benzoin, ash, goat hair tincture, oud, mushroom, civet, hyrax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Koala Extrait de Parfum,1866,Zoologist," A cloak of rich green velvet sweeps across the Australian horizon, the majestic eucalypt forest flattering every curve of the undulating landscape. Tucked high in the crook of a tree, the koala is oblivious to the mesmerizing views. It would rather curl into a ball and sleep off a feast of oily eucalyptus, the aromatic leaves that sustain it. Despite their sleepy demeanour and friendly expression, koalas are territorial creatures. Males mark the soaring trunks with their musk, establishing their dominance.Zoologist Koala opens with an invigorating blend of lemony honey and the sweet aroma of eucalyptus. They float above a blanket of black tea and spices, then draw you even deeper into musky amber and woods. The result is a unique and carefree scent that snuggles in around you, enveloping you in an embrace both playful and independent."," Eucalyptus, menthol honey gumdrops, mimosa, black tea, geranium, incense, spices, vetiver, musk, amber, oakmoss, vanilla, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76028.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Homme A La Rose Eau de Parfum,2650,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," Francis Kurkdjian has a talent for making masculines that balance French sophistication with modern style- classic enough to impress, cool enough to wear anywhere. And while he's already given men a sultry, evening rose with Lumiere Noire, his newest release reinvents the masculine rose as a fresh, bright, all-day sexy stunner. L'Homme A La Rose doesn't lack for floral strength, as it's built around a dynamic pair of two of the world's most renowned roses: deep, sweet Damask roses from Bulgaria, and smooth, fresh Centifolia rose from Grasse. A fruity, zesty grapefruit accord accentuates the floral roundness, while a dynamic ambery wood accord blends with aromatic sage for a contemporary, distinctive signature. A rose that any man will want atop his wardrobe, L'Homme A La Rose is a new standard for masculine florals."," Grapefruit, Damascene rose, amber woods accord, sage, Centifolia rose, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49890.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rozu Eau de Parfum,2684,Aesop," The beauty of Aesop fragrances lies in their ability to elegantly balance between sophistication and naturalism- an Aesop scent is gorgeously refined, yet possessed with an unmistakable and primal connection to the raw materials from which it was created. So it shouldn't surprise anyone to hear that their foray into rose scents is no delicate young flower, but a lush, gorgeously green wild rose with vibrant shiso accords, woods and spice, and a light touch of sophisticated smoke. The rose note is sumptuously romantic, with enough floral fullness to make any rose lover swoon, but the eastern influence of the aromatics and guaiac wood impart a soulful spirituality that set Rozu apart. A beautiful floral that's every bit an Aesop scent, Rozu is a must try for rose lovers."," Rose, shiso, guaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30156.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Champs Lunaires Eau de Toilette,1754,Rogue Perfumery," An intangible summer night; Moonlit fields of white flowers.Inspired by Serge Lutens' Tubereuse Crimenelle, and the lusty creamy fruit notes of Piguet's Fracas, Champs Lunaires, was an intense journey for perfumer Manuel Cross, a personal challenge to create a tuberose of satisfying balance -- indolic, green, buttery, creamy, realistic, uplifting."," Tuberose, White Rose Petals, Pomelo, Sandalwood, Coconut Milk, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Prends-Moi Eau de Parfum,1866,Isabey," Take me.It's a bold and forward statement in any era, and in the early 1930's, when Isabey first released Prends-Mois (as it was called then), it was shockingly controversial- and highly coveted. Now, the iconic scent has been relaunched as Prends-Moi, and we're pleased to report the fragrance housed in the emblematic red bottle has every bit of the passionate romanticism that turned heads almost a century before. Prends-Moi opens with a fiery spark of pink pepper, leading to a lush and daring contrast of florals in the heart- a light, innocent rose intertwined with bold, unapologetically carnal tuberose. The powdered elegance of lipstick is balanced against an almost animalic cocoa, representing a seduction both sophisticated and primal. Erotic, romantic, and classic, Prends-Moi is everything French perfume should be."," Bergamot, pink pepper, raspberry, rose, red satin lipstick, tuberose, cardamom, iris, cocoa, sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/27110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau de Cuisine Eau de Parfum,1293,Hilde Soliani," We've always known Hilde Soliani makes the most mouthwatering sweet scents out there, but being ""The Queen Of Gourmand"" doesn't begin and end with dessert. Eau de Cuisine, her tribute to longtime friend and renowned modern Italian chef Paolo Lo Priore, is a glorious main course of a fragrance, a spicy, savory, salty feast for the senses. A tribute to Chef Paolo's signature ""cucina convivale"" tasting experience, which emphasizes experimentation and creativity, this scent is a wonderful combination of flavors- the aquatic brine of the ocean, the sweetness of apricot and almond, the creaminess of fresh dairy, and a captivating melange of aromatic herbs and spices. It's a scent both bright and rich, lively and decadent, sure to appeal to lovers of aquatics, orientals, and gourmands alike. In other words, it's as unique as Hilde Soliani herself- not to mention her equally impressive foodie friends.","ocean, apricot, almond, fresh dairy, aromatic herbs, spices",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46643.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Disobbedienza Eau de Parfum,1335,Hilde Soliani," Disobedience does not have to be a bad thing. In the talented and unrestricted artistic imagination of a perfumer like Hilde Soliani, it represents risk-tasking, freedom, and creative liberation. Inspired by her time performing experimental theater, Disobbedienza is an olfactive tribute to blazing one's own path in the face of stultifying conformity. There are notes chosen for their symbolism- a black, rare rose, both dark and romantic; smoky, mysterious ash to represent the phoenix-like cycle of destruction and rebirth; and, as befitting the Queen of Gourmand, a sweet and spicy opening with the tantalizing fizz of fine champagne. As with many of Hilde's most distinctive and compelling offerings, Disobbedienza rejects easy categorization, and yet it's as wonderfully easy to wear as any of her magical creations. Break away from conformity- lose yourself in the whimsical, bold, and iconoclastic world of Disobbedienza today.","black rose, ash, champagne",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46644.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vanille de Tahiti Eau de Parfum,1196,Perris Monte Carlo," Native to Central America, the plant of vanilla belongs to orchid family and grows in the humid tropical forests. The most vibrant of all the varieties is the Tahitensis. This vanilla is not extracted with solvents, but through a more natural and less invasive process, known as CO2 supercritical. This process preserves all the aromatic facets of its profile and ensures an extract of the highest purity. The captivating aroma of this powerful and exotic raw material brings to life the soft texture of the vanilla pod.Vanille de Tahiti is a symphony of warm, exotic and gentle sweet notes. An enveloping vanilla enriched with floral notes of ylang ylang and champaka, while enchanting warm notes of amber mingle with musk and sandalwood."," Absolute of Ylang Ylang, Absolute of Champaca, Vanilla of Tahiti CO2, Amber, Sandalwood, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/702055.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gris Charnel Eau de Parfum,2185,BDK Parfums," Quai Saint-Bernard, near the Jardin des Plantes, the first couples arrive at the Tino-Rossi garden. As the night falls, the number of dancers increases and the bleachers fill up. Under the silver moon and the lights of the tourist barges that criss-cross the quay a few meters away, the bodies mingle to the rhythm of the music. It is then that two glances cross paths. A discreet invitation brings them to the center of the track. As if they were carried away, they dance in the heat of the night. From this hand-to-hand seduction punctuated by knowing smiles, they end up slipping away to give free flow to more carnal desires. In the early morning, the sheets give off a scent of sleepless nights, mischievous and lascivious embraces."," Fig, Black tea, Cardamom essence, Absolute of iris, Bourbon, vetiver, Sandalwood from India, Absolute of Tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/856003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Milk Musk Eau de Toilette,2626,Molton Brown," Quiet morning light gently trickles in through glazed sash glass. Billowing freshly pressed sheets on soft skin, nestled into the solacing embrace of milky notes. Comforting, warm cashmere whispers soothingly of silvery white musk as a melody of fluttery piano chords tinkle from the record player. Enjoy the tranquillity in this balance of enlivening pear, soothing musk and sensual vanilla. A unique milk accord imparts nostalgic, intimate warmth creating a space  of profound love in a private haven.Perfect for when you need to ensconce yourself in a calm, cocooning bubble, whether it's curling up with a book or a just allowing yourself a few minutes of meditation. What We Think A fresh, clean, deeply soothing musk that evokes fresh laundry and morning sunshine, enhanced with the perfect touch of mouthwatering, tonka-flecked vanilla- Milk Musk is a skin scent with a euphorically dreamlike smoothness."," pear, peach, musk, ambroxan, vanilla, white cedarwood, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/765130.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blackberry Woods Eau de Parfum,2218,Shay & Blue," Shay & Blue has a unique gift for playful sophistication- fragrances that can put a smile on your face and make your pulse elevate all at once. With its effortless combination of darkly sensual musky woods and glossy fruit notes, Blackberry Woods may be their most enchanting fusion yet. The delightful complexity is evident right from the start, with a sumptuous, mouthwatering harvest of sunny blackberry just bursting with joy, contrasted against a rich, green, and aromatic floral heart of neroli and lemon leaf. The aromatic sensuality carries into a base of darker, musky cypress wood, creating an alluring cocktail with a decidedly rebellious streak. If Blackberry Woods featured only the delicious blackberry opening, it would still be an instant summer favorite. What a gift, however, that this intoxicating, enchanting gem offers so much more."," Blackberry, neroli, lemon leaves, cypress",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lavande Romaine Eau de Parfum,1379,Perris Monte Carlo,"  At harvest time, evenings are filled with its aroma… and the sunset is colored by the newly cut flowers strewn over the fields. The humble alembics installed near the reservoirs glow with red flames into the night.Lavender is so connected to Provence that often farmers don't realize that it was introduced during the Roman invasion which gave this region the designation of ‘Provincia Romana' from which its name derives..Lavande Romaine captures the essence of these landscapes and the beauty of the lavender fields where flocks of blue butterfly's float in the air. A joyful fragrance that dances and sings a summer tune."," Lavender fine, Bleu Cedar, Cassis bourgeons, White Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/702054.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Celestial Eau de Parfum,2979,Electimuss," Heavenly, divine and of the gods. Gazing to the stars, the Romans were keen astronomers naming the planets after gods, and such was their belief in the power and influence of the skies over their destiny that they were also keen devotees of astrology.   The olibanum at the heart of this scent is a light, lemony incense with a conifer undertone, lifted by a spicy rose and underpinned by a warm woody base. Luminous, like the heavenly bodies which inspired it."," Saffron, raspberry, black pepper, olibanum, Indian rose absolut, Bulgarian rose, pepper, cedar, Paraguan guaiac wood, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/855010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Puritas Eau de Parfum,2835,Electimuss," Inspired by Vesta, the Roman goddess of purity, home and hearth. Her purity of heart and promise of fertility were symbolized in the eternal flames burning in her temples.  Puritas has a graceful floral incense heart, with bright, peppery top notes and a warm spicy base.  Like its inspiration this fragrance has an eternal elegance, simplicity and a lightness of touch."," Elemi, pink pepper, absinthe, olibanum, rose, Indian tuberose absolut, geranium, labdanum, patchouli, tonka and amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/855011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Thurible Eau de Parfum,2430,Rook Perfumes," The best kept secret about incense in perfumery is how magically versatile it is- it can be smoky, of course, but also resinous and animalic, or sparkling and fresh, or opulent and narcotic. Thurible is the rare incense scent that seems to contain it all, a wonderfully complex ode to this beloved material that still coalesces into a beautifully wearable and stylish signature. A sweet, clove-forward spice and herb blend supplements the church-ier aspects of the incense- cool, smoky, and sheer- while warmer, more resinous facets intertwine with rich, earthy labdanum and patchouli. A third chord- clean, sparkling incense with fresh rose and oakmoss- pulls everything together with a timeless twinkle. A must-smell for all incense lovers, Thurible is a comfortably sophisticated incense scent we're head over heels for."," clove, ash, sage, black pepper, labdanum, incense, rose, patchouli, leather, ambergris and moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/859004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Suede Eau de Parfum,1735,Rook Perfumes," Polarizing and provocative, Rook's take on leather is perhaps not as smooth as the name Suede might suggest, but for those who love animalic, realistically raw leather, there's nothing else like it. Smoky, rugged, untanned leather is the star, still recognizably charred and fleshy, harkening back to times where leather was still made by hand. It weaves in a rich tobacco leaf, earthy, sweet, and natural, like the leathermaker was sitting at his tanning bench with a rolled cigarette dangling from his lips. While a delicate undercurrent of smooth suede makes the name more than just playful irony, those who only love the most delicate leather scents may want to look elsewhere. But for those who love raw, animalic, smoky leather, this is a magic potion not to be missed."," suede, tobacco leaf, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/859005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Eau de Parfum,1602,Rook Perfumes," When we say we love amber scents, we don't just mean the traditional blend of labdanum and vanilla that are so often considered the definitive ""amber"" note in perfume. Which is good, because neither ingredient is anywhere to be found in Rook's new Amber scent. What we really love, however, is the spirit of amber- powerful, sensual, spiritual, and comforting, all at once- and that, this Amber has in multitudes. It opens with a genuinely hypnotic smoke note- sweetened with saffron, but rich and animalic, coaxing out the syrupy amber-maple heart like semi-fossilized resin seeping from ancient bark. A tonka bean base adds a touch of familiar vanillic tone, but stripped of the typically creamy dessert trappings. This amber glows with the intensity of late summer dusk in the wilderness, satisfyingly sweet but also exhilarating and primal. In other words, exactly what you'd hope for from Rook."," saffron, smoke, incense, amber, maple, black musk, tonka bean and resins",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/859006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Interlude Black Iris Eau de Parfum,1480,Amouage," Inspired by a 1926 close-up painting of an Iris flower by Georgia O'Keeffe, Interlude Black Iris is a deeply seductive and wickedly clever re-imagining of a regal men's classic. Just as with the original Interlude Man, a initially imposing burst of almost majestically powerful frankincense reveals a wondrously harmonious interior life as it develops; but whereas the original Interlude carried the effusive, spice-laden warmth of the baking desert sun, Black Iris is a dispatch from the inky midnight sky, stars illuminating a mouthwatering smorgasbord of rare delights. The intense aromatic oregano and rosemary of the original is toned down here, leaving the opening relatively cool, sparkling, and wet, which in turn unlocks the narcotic smoothness of buttery orris and violet leaf. Richly smoky agarwood and frankincense still carry their royal splendor, but the base leans more towards sandalwood and cedar, creamy and robust. If Interlude Man is a blinding crown of polished jewels, Interlude Black Iris is a flowing, impossibly soft velvet robe- and what king doesn't need both?"," Bergamot, rosemary, violet leaves, orris, amber, frankincense, cistus, myrrh, vanilla, leather, agarwood smoke, patchouli, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41899.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escale En Haiti Eau De Cologne,2146,Les Indemodables," Perhaps the most classic of all scents, the ""L'eau de Cologne"" style stays perpetually in fashion because of its wonderful simplicity. Featuring a lighter concentration that puts its emphasis on freshness and wearability, an EDC can actually be an ideal format to showcase exquisite natural materials in high concentrations that might feel overwhelming as part of a richer, more busy perfume. With Escale En Haiti, Les Indemodables transports us to the bustling and beautiful Les Cayes region of Haiti, and their signature crop- vetiver, considered by many to be the best in all the world. Les Cayes vetiver is renowned for its richness and depth- allowed to mature beneath the soil for up to 2 years before harvesting, it develops uniquely bright, sweet citrus tones in addition to the expected earthy and woody properties. And for Escale En Haiti, Les Indemodables uses a 22% concentration of the absolute finest vetiver Les Cayes has to offer: a ""Grand Cru"" distillation hand-selected from unique terroir, carefully root-harvested, and painstakingly distilled at atmospheric pressure, a slower and more expensive process that provides a richer, longer-lasting extract. The results are a stunning natural vetiver cologne with real depth, each ingredient carefully chosen to highlight an element of the extraordinary main ingredient. Electric pink pepper from Reunion Island and aromatic juniper oil from Macedonia bring a spicy, fresh burst, while rich Venezuelan tonka and Somalian myrrh essential oil add a touch of creamy, powdered elegance to the subtle but long-lasting base.

Escale En Indonesie Eau De Cologne,2565,Les Indemodables," Perhaps the most classic of all scents, the ""L'eau de Cologne"" style stays perpetually in fashion because of its wonderful simplicity. Featuring a lighter concentration that puts its emphasis on freshness and wearability, an EDC can actually be an ideal format to showcase exquisite natural materials in high concentrations that might feel overwhelming as part of a richer, more busy perfume. With Escale En Indonesie, Les Indemodables has chosen to showcase a spectacular specimen of one of the most precious materials in all of perfumery- ambergris. Recovered from the paradise of Sumatra, Indonesia, this top-graded white ambergris was painstakingly distilled into a ""Grand Cru"" tincture, broken down with state-of-the-art ultrasound and then carefully tinctured for over six months to achieve a sublime level of complexity. Every possible facet of this fabled material- vivid ozonic tones, sensual animalics, and electric saltiness- are fully presented, delivering a depth and longevity that are rare for an eau de cologne. And a suite of carefully chosen complementary notes add more EDC freshness- a sunny sparkle of Calabrian bergamot and Sicilian lemon combine with a green, floral freshness from Moroccan neroli oil. Each note teases out even more complexity from the ambergris, which feels as bright and refreshing as the citrus opening but soon gains creamy, seductive tonality from a smooth jasmine and sandalwood base. Don't worry if this sounds a bit heavy for an EDC, as it's delivered with a wonderfully light touch that makes it oh so wearable. But if you've ever wanted a scent that harnessed the true power of ambergris while also maintaining delightful everyday wearability, don't let this hidden gem pass you by."," Bergamot, lemon, neroli, Indonesian ambergris, jasmine, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The heart of fresh ginger is even more straightforward- a crackling fireball of invigorating, nose-tickling spice with a subtle twist of sweetness that leads into a pink pepper and cardamom base that weaves gourmand, aromatic, clean, and woodsy aspects all together in a lingering and increasingly smooth experience. The best fresh scents from Heeley carry truly unforgettable olfactory signatures- the minty pop of Menthe Fraiche, the salty tang of Sel Marin; the intoxicating burn of Zeste de Gingembre places it firmly in that rarefied company."," Lemon, lime, orange zest, fresh ginger, pink pepper, cardamom",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31528.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Escentric 05 - Travel Spray Eau de Toilette,2715,Escentric Molecules," ""With Escentric 05 I wanted to create a different kind of summer fragrance. Instead of the usual aqueous notes, I was inspired by walking up from the sea on a hot afternoon through dry, aromatic Mediterranean herbs and trees."" -Geza SchoenCashmeran, the molecule at the heart of the 05 series, is dry, radiant, warm and woody with an unexpected touch of pine resin. It's this vibrant quality that caused Geza Schoen to flash back to the Mediterranean, where he spent his childhood summers, and as a result Escentric 05 is truly a different kind of summer scent, infused with vivid, glowing warmth and the contrast of sun-baked plants and trees.Escentric 05 opens with a wonderfully simply top of light, fresh bergamot, and a bright and happy orange note, chosen to represent the orange groves of our hypothetical island destination. Laurel and rosemary carry a signature freshness and spiciness, while a the herbal character of juniper plays against the dry, pungent woodiness of cypress. The drydown features two classic Mediterranean ingredients- cistus labdanum, with its sweet, leathery, balsamic richness, and mastic, a tree-based resin with the clean, sharp scent of newly-cut branches. And they're both layered over the signature 05 Series ingredient, cashmeran- an intoxicating 15% concentration within the formula that provides sensual, woodsy warmth. Far from a typically ""freshie"" summer scent, Escentric 05 captures the emotional warmth of summer memories in a scent with all the signature stylishness of Escentric Molecules."," Fig, bergamot, orange, laurel, rosemary, juniper, basil, hedione, cypress, freesia, iris, jasmine, cashmeran, cistus labdanum, musc, ambroxan, mastic, iso e super",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30861.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1979 New Wave Eau de Parfum,2360,Les Bains Guerbois," As the seventies turned to the eighties, the nightlife at Bains Douches turned from the glitzy excess of disco to a new sound that was both melodic and modern, but also rawer and more emotionally intense than what had come before. As an ode to this New Romanticism and its dark and cheerful contradictions, 1979 New Wave is a truly intriguing combination of exceptionally bright, aldehydic herbaceous notes contrasted against a rich base of gorgeous, woodsy orris. The cool, bracing freshness of a mint bouquet explodes off the skin, the aldehydes providing a modern, gently soapy sparkle, which lifts up the (dare we say gloomy?) sensuality of the buttery orris heart, which otherwise might sink under its own complex richness. The smoothly musky base supports both the lighter and darker aspects of the scent, as crisp, aromatic cedarwood keeps the energy up while creamy sandalwood and warm amber coax warmer aspects from the orris. Looking for a new, sexy take on iris/orris? 1979 New Wave is here to transport you."," Peppermint, Spearmint, Aldehydes, Orris Concrete, Virginia Cedar, Australian Sandalwood, Musk, Amber Wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

She freshens up, touches her make-up: red velour lipstick, sometimes Bordeaux depending on her mood. She brushes her hair and takes her necklace out from her purse. Her white shirt slightly open highlights her inviting curves. She adds a bit more black to her eyes. She slams the front door as her heels strides on the sidewalk. Just like every Thursdays, she's going to the cabaret Place de la Concorde. Madam has high hopes like every night. She likes people; she loves life. She finds a stool at the bar and orders a whiskey with ice before lighting her cigarette. In the darkness, she makes out a silhouette in front of her. She turns to the side. It's him. It's always him. Their paths often cross but they never speak. She smiles, gets up and goes dancing. Alone. Men line up for her attention, she politely replies. Madam is chic, she responds. Close to 2am, a dandy looking man catches her eyes and invites her to dance. She abides but only for a short period, she leans in says she has to go home. She likes him but the morning is soon approaching. She leaves after whispering these words in his ear...

Dolceacqua Eau de Parfum,1330,Masque Milano," Nice, 8am. Sunshine and light traffic on the Promenade des Anglais. Here she comes, with the soft top down, and you jump in. As the road unwinds, the view of the gulf suddenly becomes amazing. Her colorful Hermes foulard sweeps with the breeze and you breathe deeply to catch the rich mixture of Cote d'Azur flavors, in their magic blend of floral and marine. She parks at a panoramic spot and draws out of the back of the car a basket with your breakfast. She doesn't mind sitting on the ground, she bought her lovely dress at the market stalls for a few dollars and it is not worth worrying about. What a woman! - you think - she can match a few-dollar-dress with such an astonishing pearl necklace. You open a bottle of Beaujolais wine and lean towards her to pour some wine into her glass. You can't help stopping pouring wine and close your eyes, as you smell her perfume. So much in line with her, with her style: sweet and mellow, a mixture of flowers and fruit and some hints of vanilla at the base."," Coastal Breeze accord, Muguet, Ivy Leaves, Mediterranean Marjoram, Mimosa, Almond Flower, White Rose, Ylang-Ylang Nosy Be, Saffron Flower, Cedarwood Virginia, Benjoin Siam, Oakmoss, Silky Musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/640013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Magnolia Grandiflora - Michel Eau de Parfum,2457,Grandiflora," Michel Roudnitska's expressive, sensuous compositions are few and far between. An accomplished photographer and fervent traveler, he has all but given up commercial perfumery to dedicate himself to other pursuits. But when he met Saskia Havekes, a renowned Australian floral designer, he offered her – and perfume lovers – a priceless gift: the formula of a magnolia fragrance inspired by the magnolia tree in his parents', now his, garden near Grasse. The scent he had worked on for his own pleasure had found a home at Grandiflora.Magnolia Grandiflora Michel is part of a pair of fragrances, both dedicated to Grandiflora's namesake blossom. An unusual debut for a fledgling brand, but a vibrant, emotional tribute to the story behind the scents, since the other magnolia was composed by the late Sandrine Videault, whose mentors were Michel's parents Edmond and ThÃ©rÃ¨se Roudnitska.While Sandrine's magnolia is fresh and shimmering, Michel's interpretation expresses the flower in its full bloom, with its lush waxy petals. As spectacular as a blossom-heavy magnolia tree, with a dark woody undercurrent boosting the heady floral bouquet.

Bathed in shades of highly desirable blue, urban and contemporary violence paradoxically becomes hypnotic.""Anti-Blues, the first in Pierre Guillaume's new Confidentiel series, is a dark gourmand that, like the paintings of Monory, bathes warm mineral and woody gourmand notes in a cool blue wash of frankincense, combining the dangerous and the delicious. The frankincense is stark and cold, mixed with an almost alien vetiver, disguising the imposing woody bitterness coming from cacao, saffron, and amyris. Touches of hay and dark chocolate coax out the animal nuances of vanilla, already dirtied with leather and tobacco. It's a fragrance of olfactory illusion, enticing edible notes and seductive woods painting a distinctly tinted portrait of delectable darkness."," Dark chocolate, saffron, grapefruit, incense, resin, amyris, cacao wood, hay, tobacco, vetiver, leather, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/545018.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Fuyu Eau de Parfum,2855,Tom Daxon," Inspired by the delicate juiciness of a Japanese fuyu persimmon, Fuyu is a floral skin musk of unique refinement and subtle yet indescribable pleasure. It opens on an accord of exceptional cleverness- white peach providing the sophisticated sweetness and cedarwood delivering a subtly creamy woodsiness that together create the illusion of a soft, perfectly ripe persimmon. The heart notes quickly unfold, revealing a bouquet of beguilingly powdery iris set against a luscious jasmine that keeps the fruity tones balanced. And all is laid softly on a bed of pillowy musks that surround the skin, softening, soothing, and purring with gentle sensuality. It's a true beauty of a skin scent, as perfect for iris lovers as it is for fans of subtly fruity musks- a fragrance with minimal intensity, but maximum complexity, and one that proves that Tom Daxon's talents extend to every aspect of fragrance."," White peach, jasmine, iris, soft musks, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62632.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Perfumista Eau de Parfum,1069,Anatole Lebreton," In a world where artistry is ever more commoditized and luxury so often conflated with price, individuality is the rarest treasure- the ""luxury of being yourself."" That's the promise of Perfumista, a fruity, woody floral beauty that evokes some of the grand feminine chypres of years past, yet glows with the unique loveliness that infuses all of Anatole Lebreton's creations.

DOULEUR! - an oxidized rose”Douleur means ""pain, "" which is a seemingly appropriate name for a fragrance created in collaboration with UK tattoo artist and bondage master Freddie Albrighton. But fear not- Douleur understands the intersection of pleasure and pain,  and this uniquely bright,  sweet,  minty metallic rose is as utterly compelling as it is unexpected,  blending modern and gothic influences to feel both wholly Bogue,  and yet also like a departure from Gardoni's typical vintage-influenced animalic florals.

Ambre Stone Eau de Parfum,1659,Anthologie de Grands Crus," In Ambre Stone, a juicy burst of bergamot takes an autumnal and sensual turn with the earthy addition of patchouli, rich sandalwood with a hint of indolic jasmine. But it's real ambergris that takes this scent to a whole new level, sprinkling the composition with that ingredient's inimitable fairy dust, adding warmth, coziness, and sensuality like the golden light of an autumn sun on a picturesque summer scene.Due to its rarity and cost, ambergris (grey amber), the aged and oxidized exudate from a whale””at once sweet, earthy, marine and animalic””is largely found in synthetic form in perfume. But this almost mythic ingredient is in a 5% dose in Ambre Stone, adding a dreamy sensuousness to the edges of the fragrance's brightness. As with all ingredients sourced by L'Atelier FranÃ§ais des MatiÃ¨res, the lump of ambergris is first selected from a trusted partner. Then, Jean Philippe Paris, AFDM's scientific director, processes the ambergris for around six months into a tincture or infusion, until it is deemed, along with the evaluation of perfumer Antoine Lie, to be ready to use. Ambre Stone, by the time it dries down, is a skin scent of voluptuous beauty that will have you inhaling yourself with abandon."," Ambergris infusion, Indonesian Patchouli oil, Egyptian Jasmine absolute late crop, Moroccan Neroli oil, Indian Sandalwood oil, Italian Bergamot oil late crop",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/836000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

It smells pretty sexy over here."," Madagascan vanilla olÃ©orÃ©sin, Somalian Olibanum, Madagascan Clove bud oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/836001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bergamote de G. Franco Eau de Parfum,1498,Anthologie de Grands Crus," In a tiny area of Reggio in Calabria Italy, around the strait of Messina, crops provide the bergamot oil so crucial to perfumery, lending its bright, luscious, aromatic citrus qualities to untold number of fragrances.

Jasmin de Cherifa's real jasmine will take you on a journey of the flower's scent life cycle and in the process, taking your breathe away...Cherifa was asked to use the flowers from their fields' early, middle, and late crops to provide the full olfactive spectrum of the jasmine they harvest from June to October. Early jasmine, from June and July, is fresh and fruity. It turns floral and creamy midway through, in August, maturing into an animalic, indolic beauty in September. And that, along with an Egyptian rose absolute centifolia and a creamy Indian sandalwood to sing in its chorus, is what you get.Velvety, fruity, creamy, and sensuous, with a surprise touch of clary sage for added brightness and dimension, Jasmin de Cherifa is a revelation demonstrating that its simplicity of construction makes it even more elegant and luxurious. As Oscar Wilde once said,“I'm a man of simple tastes. I'm always satisfied with the best.”"," Egyptian Jasmine absolute Grand Cru, Egyptian Rose absolute centifolia Grand Cru (also from Cherifa's fields), Indian Sandalwood Grand Cru",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/836004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
I Love YY,1466,Bogue Profumo," I LOVE YY is Antonio Gardoni's dual declaration of love- first, to New York City, a place he fell over heels for from his very first visit. But that title isn't a typo- YY, another object of his affection, is short for Ylang Ylang, that uniquely big, open, complex floral known for all the ways it smells unlike any other flower- sometimes grassy, sometimes gourmand, sometimes woodsy and resinous. When we asked Antonio to make us an exclusive fragrance to celebrate the opening of our first NYC boutique, he connected NY and YY, and the rest was a match made in heaven- or, at least, in the heart of Nolita.And leave it to Antonio to construct a fragrance that truly captures the energy and beauty of NYC. I LOVE YY is a whirlwind of delightful chaos, with perfect touches of New York everywhere you look- cold, fizzy grapefruit captures a brisk spring morning run in Central Park. The titular ylang note is camphorous and lactonic, joining tonka, rose, and jasmine to feel sweet and rich, buzzing like a packed after-hours party. Cold, fizzy grapefruit captures a brisk spring morning run in Central Park. An edgy violet leaf recalls the flashbulbs and fluorescents of a hot new gallery opening in the Meatpacking District. And all of these notes intertwine in a glorious hum of energy, light, sweetness and intoxicating depth that can only represent one single, gigantic, overwhelming, wonderful city. We couldn't be more excited that Antonio Gardoni and Bogue chose to join us in our inaugural NYC adventure. Won't you come with us?"," Ylang ylang, grapefruit, jasmine, rose, tonka, violet leaf, vanilla, benzoin, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66932.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
New York Eau de Parfum,2824,Widian," New York City in the spring may be the most magical place in the world. For once a year, the electric bustle of the city is balanced with delightfully mild temperatures, gentle sunshine, and a fresh breeze that draws even the most cynical citydwellers out into New York's beautiful and far-flung public spaces, now teeming with the energy of new life. This is the inspiration for New York, the latest in Widian's tribute to the great cities, an explosion of bright citrus, spicy florals, and musky woods that positively vibrates with the extraordinary dynamism of the Big Apple. All the energy of a New York spring is present from the very first spray, as New York bursts forth with sun-soaked notes of lemon, bergamot, and mandarin, kissed with a burst of pink pepper. The spicy, aromatic bouquet only grows richer in the romantic heart notes, as striking floral notes of lavender, geranium and rose are combined with coriander and juniper, conjuring a lusciously fresh and deeply sensual tone. And as the smooth, ambered base of tobacco, musk, and never-too-heavy vanilla emerges, you can practically feel the sun setting, and a nighttime of endless possibilities on the horizon. It's just another perfect spring day in the greatest city in the world."," Bergamot, mandarin, lemon, pink pepper, lavender, coriander, juniper, geranium, orris, rose, akigala, jasmine, patchouli, caramel, vetiver, cypriol, white musk, white amber, vanilla, ambergris, olibanum, tonka, tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/709015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gold II Sahara Parfum Extrait,1690,Widian," Like its companion fragrance Gold I, the luminous, captivating Gold II (now presented as Gold II Sahara) is built around the fragrance accord most associated with the precious metal- amber. But while Gold I's amber was powerful and opulent, Sahara is luxuriously smooth, a floral musk with a deep, soft muskiness that evaporates the concerns and trivialities of everyday life in a wondrous cloud of creamy, gently powdery sensuality.On the very first spray of Sahara, a remarkably uplifting opening of bright citrus, rich saffron and spicy elemi invigorates, before the softness of the rose and orange blossom heart steadies the tempo and soothes the soul. In the deep, sweet base, creamy vanillic amber and musky cedarwood relax and seduce. The beauty of gold is its versatility, the ability to dazzle with subtlety as easily as with excess. In Gold II Sahara, Widian chooses that subtle road less traveled, and you're sure to go along for the journey."," Saffron, orange, elemi, rose, orange blossom, amber, musk, cedar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70906.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bengale Rouge Eau de Parfum,2044,Papillon Artisan Perfumes," Inspired by the stunning, tiger-like dappling of shade and light on the fur of her Bengal cat Mimi, Liz Moore's latest creation is a soft, cozily-spiced oriental that's as sensuous as a cat in full stretch. Miles away from the overt sexuality of Salome, Bengale Rouge's only hint of the animalic is the honeyed, fuzzy glow of the resins, which give the perfume a sensual warmth that's more kitten than tiger. Bengale Rouge dips a soft, attar-like rose and sandalwood into a doughy, rooty iris and wraps it all up in a halo of headily-spiced resins. It's simply gorgeous. With its benzoin-rich vanilla swirled with caramelized labdanum, clove-scented opoponax, and the citrusy brightness of a Turkish rose, Bengale Rouge at first appears to take up the glittering mantle of the great orientals of the past, such as Shalimar and Opium. However, we are steered away from the powdered classicism of these perfumes by the clever addition by the perfumer of a dollop of edible vanilla that lends the scent a modern gourmand vibe that will have you wanting to lick your own skin. The vanilla gourmand aspect doesn't dominate; but neither does the dry and spicy resin facet – they dance and intertwine like perfect halves of one whole for a golden, opulent effect that perfectly mimics the interplay of light and dark on Mimi's fur coat. It's a total love from us. What We Think A ravishing blend of warm, powdery gourmand and gently animalic notes to delight and seduce in equal measure."," Turkish rose, orris, sandalwood, sweet myrrh (opoponax), oakmoss, honey, vanilla, tonka bean, benzoin, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/665006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Avatar Eau de Parfum,2281,Hilde Soliani," Do we even have to tell you at this point that Hilde Soliani is the undisputed Queen of Gourmand? If there's even a shred of doubt left in your mind, we urge you to indulge in Avatar, Hilde's latest and greatest, which pulls off the wonderful trick of re-creating the exact smell the moment you walk into an ice cream store. We bet you can picture it just from reading the words- the sweet, mouthwatering aroma of cream and sugar diffused into the crisp snap of cold, with the subtly savory crunch of waffle cone ever present in the background. It's that simple but oh so nostalgic tableau that Hilde has created with Avatar, inspired by Paolo Brunelli, proprietor of Compagnia Gelatieri, and as with all of her marvelous gourmands, the magic isn't in unnecessary embellishments or needless complication, but in the sheer alchemy of how perfect the facsimile is- the milky, sugary, crisply cool ice cream is pitch perfect, evoking immediate memories of childhood summers and palaces of frozen delight. The Queen of Gourmand has done it again."," Caramel, sugar, milk, biscuits",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46642.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Midnight Saffron Eau de Parfum,1424,Tom Daxon," Lavender is having a moment, as fragrance houses everywhere are tossing aside its reputation as a sleep-inducing hippie oil, and rediscovering its electric sensuality. Midnight Saffron, born of Tom Daxon's long standing love for lavender, takes this energy and runs wild with it, mixing up a potent cocktail of spicy woods to create a vibrantly sexy scent that will carry you into the wee hours. As the name would suggest, the central spice involved is saffron, which here is stripped of its more foody elements to reveal the raw, crackling carnality underneath- which, in turn, amps up the animalic energy of the exquisite lavender note, created from a mixture of France and Bulgaria's finest lavender oils and absolutes. As Midnight Saffron dries, a smoothly woodsy leather note enhances and refines, but the energy never dips, even in the drydown. As we mentioned at the top, Midnight Saffron is a different take on lavender- one that's ready to stay up just as late as you are."," Saffron, lavender, jasmine, suede, amber woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62631.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dolls Eau de Parfum,1925,Moth and Rabbit," ""A fragrance carried by vivid, extravagant colours and a surrealistic story about uncompromising love: all consuming and bordering insanity. A heavy perfume, based on animalistic notes interrupted by the subtle and light smell of snow; so repulsive in smell, so attractive in colours, so unreal.""Dolls, a beautifully stylized fever dream of a movie directed by Japanese icon Takeshi Kitano, tackles themes of love, death, sacrifice, and freedom- complex issues that its namesake scent more than lives up to. Dolls the fragrance is every bit as abstract and experiential as its inspiration, delivering extreme but balanced bursts of animalic musks, rich florals, sweet woods, and a fuzzed-out snowflake accord that shrouds the composition in a mysterious cloak of cold freshness. This is not a scent to passively wear out on the town, but a true companion piece to a film that defies easy interpretation but delivers exceptional rewards to those with the soul to proceed. Enjoy it accordingly."," Cherry blossom, geranium, davana, orange blossom, ylang ylang, apple blossom, rose, sweet maple accord, musk, snow flake accord, ambergris, cedar, animalic notes.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/666010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Opale Eau de Parfum,1806,Omnia Profumo," Truly a breath of fresh air, Opale is a gem of a marine floral that evokes the sun-drenched gardens and sparkling waters of the Mediterranean coast. From the very first spritz, a symphony of gentle florals flits through the air, combining the soft purity of jasmine and lilac with delicately spicy and earthy notes of hawthorne and geranium. But the core of the scent is an oh-so-oceanside note of fresh, salty, ozonic seaweed that wraps around a smooth and lively white musk to create a pitch-perfect image of a relaxing coastal breeze, which lingers for hours thanks to touches of woodsy and gourmand notes to accentuate and enrich the authentically oceanic tang. Carefree, lively, and joyful, Opale is an aquatic scent for the romantic in us all."," Jasmine, lilac, hawthorne, geranium, seaweed, white musk, patchouli, cedar, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46111.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Poudrextase Eau de Parfum,2868,Marlou," With a name that combines the French words for ""powder"" and ""ecstasy, "" it's not difficult to imagine what Marlou has in mind with their newest fragrance. But concept alone can't do justice to Pourdrextase; after all,  this is Marlou we're talking about here,  a line that does one thing- intensely erotic,  deeply animalic musk- and does it just about better than anyone. And even if their smolderingly over-the-top previous releases have been a bit too intense for you,  we'd strongly encourage you to try again,  as Poudrextase explores a duality of skin scents- on one hand,  the primal musk,  on the other,  the fresh powder and minimal florals of expensive cosmetics on clean skin- and the result is Marlou's most wonderfully accessible scent yet. Here,  the rice powder is bright and fresh,  almost citrussy,  and the dried rose just delicately sweet enough to smooth out the funk of the animalics,  which retain every ounce of the full-bodied carnality of Marlou's previous gems. It's very much a portrait of skin in full- the proper and the profane,  the clean and the dirty. We're entranced."," Rice powder, dried rose, cypress, civet, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Single Man Eau de Parfum,2668,Moth and Rabbit," It is the gay man that got me curious, troubled by ordinary grief and haunted by joy, a man apart and yet like any other; Followed by numbness, routine, sorrow and perhaps another kind of awakening. It is a fragrance based on a variety of woody notes such as violet wood, cashmere wood, mahogany and cedar wood; that reflects the man who constructs or reconstructs a personality to bear the weight of loss, and whom society will not permit to grieve. – MARK BUXTON, perfumer What We Think Humming with restrained intensity, Single Man features a rich accord of dry, resinous woods and dark spice, freshened slightly with a semisweet, oily citrus note. It's a quietly powerful scent for those who don't want to fill the room but still want to make a statement."," Cardamom, Ginger Oil, Red Pepper, Winter Lemon Oil, Nutmeg, Rose, Elemi Oil, Violet Wood, Cashmere Wood, Oakmoss, Amber, Patchouli, Mahogany, Cedar.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/666009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Whisky Oud Parfum Concentration,1341,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," Rich, smooth, and indulgent, Whisky Oud is the height of masculine luxury. In this enchanting elixir, the sweet booziness of a pitch perfect note of scotch whiskey blends seductively with a perfect base of smooth, supple leather and deep, powerful oud for a fragrance that exudes pure, powerful elegance. Accents of fiery spice, incense, and wood only heighten the sophistication. Whether you're kicking back with a 20-year Highland in a wood-panelled room by a roaring fire- or you just want to smell like you are- Whisky Oud is a rare treasure."," Labdanum, incense, whisky, saffron, suede, oud, cedar, vetiver, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44026.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Limited 71 Intense Eau de Parfum,1725,Widian," Named for the 1971, the year that the United Arab Emirates declared their independence and sovereignty, Limited 71 is a lavishly celebratory new release from the house of Widian. Balancing an opening wave of fresh citrus and sweet spice against a smooth, enchanting heart of smoky woods, ambergris and patchouli, Limited 71 excites and hypnotizes in equal measure.

Lambrosc Eau de Parfum,2643,Hilde Soliani," Lambrusco is having a moment. Dry, crisp, sweet, and gently sparkling, this fun and fizzy wine from Hilde Soliani's native Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy has overcome its image as a cheap, mass-produced wine to become a worldwide sensation. Perfect as an aperitif, able to be paired with nearly any meal, Lambrusco is finally gaining recognition as a versatile, wonderful wine. With Lambrosc, Hilde recreates the effervescent joy of a perfect Lambrusco di Sorbara, the most sophisticated of Lambruscos, bursting with juicy berry flavor perfectly balanced against dry, sweet floral tones. Just like the real thing, Lambrosc is a perfect treat for any occasion- fun and relaxed enough for everyday wear, but elegant and bold in a formal setting. In other words, there's really no reason not to enjoy it as soon as possible."," Sweet red fruits, red wine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46641.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Donna Sentenza Eau de Parfum,1175,Hilde Soliani," Donna Sentenza was born of a joke Hilde Soliani shared with famed Italian butcher, Simone Fracassi, about her possibly slipping on a banana peel. Hilde Soliani slip on a banana peel? Never! Donna Sentenza, the perfume, has the same zany sense of humor and zest for life as Hilde Soliani herself. Known for her special touch with gourmandise, Soliani now turns her attention to banana, making a perfume that's so fun that we all want in on the joke.  Banana milkshake. Banana pudding from Magnolia Bakery in New York. Banana cream pie. When life is getting you down, why not take a break from it all and put a smile back on your face with this deliciously milky banana concoction? Donna Sentenza smells exactly like banana pudding, with layers of banana sandwiched with whipped cream, sugar, and a hint of smoky Nilla wafers around the edges. All good fun, of course, but underpinning it all is Soliani's seriously good vanilla, the buttery, high quality stuff that makes you want to bite your own arm. Nobody does a cream note quite like Soliani, and now we're convinced of her special banana powers too. So, if you want to smell like banana pudding from time to time (and honestly, who doesn't?) but insist on it being a super high-end, artisanal banana pudding with no nasty aftertaste, then look no further than Hilde Soliani's Donna Sentenza. It's literally the (banana) bomb."," Banana, cream, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46640.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Manteuse Eau de Parfum,1998,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," A play on words combining the deadly praying mantis with the french word for ""deceiver, "" Manteuse is quite clearly not meant to be a gentle fragrance. Instead,  this bold new floral from Stephane Humbert Lucas is a swaggering,  sensuous throwback to the unapologetic musky florals of the 1990s,  strong,  warm,  and utterly mesmerizing. Opening with a rich,  vivid blast of bergamot and bright white florals,  Manteuse stuns its prey before injecting its poison,  a deeply narcotic,  languorous blend of sweet honey and rich,  resin-flushed iris. As the deeply powdery,  smoothly seductive base of woodsy musks takes hold,  we find ourselves utterly paralyzed,  gripped with uncontrollable pleasure,  defenseless against the gorgeous power of the scent. For those who still long for bold,  sexy fragrances meant to unapologetically turn heads,  Manteuse is bound to be your newest obsession."," Bergamot, white flowers, leather, honey, iris, labdanum, sandalwood, smoked vanilla, shangrilade musk, oppoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/655015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Against Nature Eau de Parfum,2095,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes," Inspired by Joris-Karl Huysmans' 1884 novel of the same name which broke from his naturalist roots, this is a decadent re-interpretation of nature at its most ornate, along with an undercurrent of unmistakably human components. Like the journey of Huysmans' protagonist, who isolated himself from earth in order to re-build himself outside of conventional society, the scent is both primal and intellectual, compelling and disturbing, untethered and utterly unapologetic. Intense notes of lush leafy green foliage, moist soil & earthy mosses merge with with notes of cold metal, blood and lacquer, invoking a wildly unique atmosphere somewhere between the primordial world and the flawed, brilliant human soul. Vivid and intriguing, this is most certainly not a scent for everyone- something Huysmans would most certainly approve of."," Pink pepper, lemon, juniper, green notes, metal, jasmine, ylang ylang, lacquer, musk, vetiver, sandalwood, amber, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cornaline Eau de Parfum,2598,Anatole Lebreton," When Anatole Lebreton conceptualizes a new fragrance, we sit up and take notice. After all, his brand aesthetic goes far beyond packaging or signature notes- a Lebreton scent is a uniquely formed work of art, with rustic, romantic and fantastical elements all hypnotically intertwined to create scents that stand alone as works of individual creativity. Cornaline, an ode to brightness and light and color, is no exception- by combining unexpected natural elements of spice, fruit, and florals, Lebreton delivers a dazzlingly bright scent that slowly, deliberately transitions into a twinkling twilight. Cornaline opens with a distinctive and unforgettable note of carrot root, almost synthetic feeling in its uniqueness, the perfect lead-in to a cascade of fruits and flowers that radiate with distinctive and unforgettable color. First, geranium shines forth with spicy assertiveness, followed by an energetic vibration of orris, and a fruit-inflected, beautifully sweet ylang ylang. Now, the fruits and florals explode forth, painting a vivid mural of springtime delights with distinct touches of hyacinth and ""belle du jour"" mirabilis, a perfect blend of spicy and fruity. And finally, an increasingly sensual bed of musk and vanilla glows with the poised relaxation of twilight. Joyful yet masterfully restrained, opulent yet luminous, Cornaline is another opus from one of niche perfume's brightest lights."," Carrot root, geranium, orris, ylang ylang, peach, red berries, green notes, mirabilis, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70805.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bluebijou Eau de Parfum,2480,Piotr Czarnecki," For far too long, ""blue"" has been used to describe the most generic of fragrances- blandly masculine, synthetically aquatic, outright boring. But blue is so much more interesting than that- a blue scent should be hypnotically deep, harmoniously balanced, compellingly full of life. Enter Bluebijou, a unique, vibrant, unrestrained reinterpretation of the blue scent. Instead of scratchy, synthetic freshness, Bluebijou delivers juicy, sumptuous blueberry, bright violet, rich cocoa, and unmistakable truffle, all atop an impossibly deep base of dark oud and deeply boozy cognac. It's sweet, smooth, juicy and magical- and you'll never look at an underwhelming ""blue"" department store scent the same."," Violet, blueberry, cacao, truffle, tobacco, dark chocolate, cognac, oud, cashmeran, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kiviskin Eau de Parfum,1799,Piotr Czarnecki," Inspired by the beauty of luxury leather goods, Kiviskin is a bracingly fresh, invigoratingly natural-feeling scent, painting a bold portrait of spice, tobacco and suede. A richly tingling blend of saffron, nutmeg and pimento opens with vibrant energy and airy brightness, leading into a fresh, wild tobacco note with ample tonalities of spicy green, as if the plant is still firmly rooted in the field. As the leather emerges, buttressed with unsweetened dark chocolate and resinous benzoin, the result is a leather fragrance with unquestionable depth but dynamic natural freshness, and a interpretation of leather we're pleased to say we've never before experienced. Authentically deep, intriguingly modern, Kiviskin is a leather that only Piotr Czarnecki could give us."," Saffron, nutmeg, pimento, violet, tobacco, dark chocolate, benzoin, cedar, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Venom of Angel Eau de Parfum,1146,Piotr Czarnecki," Easy to love, impossible to forget, Venom of Angel is a mouthwatering and unique coconut gourmand with a surprisingly original depth. Inspired by the feeling of first entering a world-class nightclub, Venom of Angel captures the rush of light, sound, and adrenaline from the first sniff, as energetic green aloe vera and crackling black pepper burst forth, leading into a richly intoxicating cocktail of sweet, boozy rum and a wildly sexy coconut-cedar accord, creamy, spicy, and powerful. Whispers of smokey sacramental incense add mystery and deepen the allure, while a decadent white chocolate note adds an undeniable aphrodisiac quality. Part innocence, part decadence, Venom of Angel is among the most seductive scents we've smelled in quite some time."," Coconut, olibanum, black pepper, aloe vera, sugar cane, rum, ivy, cedar, white chocolate",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hili Eau de Parfum,1811,Widian," A lush flower garden surrounding extraordinarily preserved structures and sites dating back to the Bronze Age, the Hili Archaeological Park and Gardens is one of the true treasures of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Drawing inspiration from the magical location, Hili, the latest from Widian's Velvet Collection, is a stunning floral oriental that captures the delicate beauty of the gardens and the intriguing mysteries of the historic site in one compelling fragrance.Hili opens with a vibrantly colorful burst of bergamot and pink pepper, laced with a balanced strain of coriander and cinnamon. The floral heart, the true star of the show, blooms with delicate lushness, the jasmine and tuberose soft and non-indolic, the ylang and tiare sweet and gently powdered, all atop a base of smooth woods and a distinctively creamy coconut milk that the ethereally smooth florals sink into with seamless grace. All told, it perfectly represents the gardens it models itself on: a work of dreamlike beauty, expertly engineered to seem effortless."," Bergamot, pink pepper, coriander, cinnamon, jasmine, tuberose, ylang ylang, tiare, amber, vanilla, coconut milk, sandalwood, patchouli, cedar, tobacco leaf",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70913.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Niral Eau de Parfum,1783,Neela Vermeire Creations," Neela Vermeire has always been a line of unmatched elegance, where the rich cultural heritage of India and the refinement of western perfumery go hand in hand to create enchanting, delightful fragrances. Niral, from a Hindi word and name connoting uniqueness and serenity, is inspired by Sir Thomas Wardle, a 19th-century expert in the sericulture and the Indian wild silk trade, and so it's only appropriate that the fragrance is a stunningly smooth blend of florals, spices and musks that's as silky as they come. Opening with a refined iris, smoothed with tea and liqueur notes to balance earthy, papery and floral in perfect equilibrium, Niral gently reveals a luxuriously rich, yet subtle heart of rose, spice and musks, atop an equally serene base of precious woods and supple leather. Like Sir Thomas's silk, which was used by the eras most prestigious designers and textile artists, it's sheer textural delight, softness and sophistication all in one, and a melding of the most elegant techniques that both India and Europe have to offer- you won't want to miss it."," Iris, pink pepper, tea, Turkish rose, green wine lees, cabreuva, angelica seed, ambrette seed, cardamom, leather, magnolia, jasmine, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56509.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
London Eau de Parfum,1904,Widian," The Sapphire Collection, a new collection by Widian, formerly AJ Arabia, is the perfect fusion of East meets West. The East: Widian, an Arabian niche perfume firm inspired by the architecture of Sheikh Zayed's Grand Mosque and the modern Arab spirit in the city of Abu Dhabi. The West: the glittering cityscapes of the grandest Western cities, such as London, Paris, and New York. Traditional Arabic perfumery meets Western abstraction; a perfect fusion of the old and the new, the traditional and the contemporary, and yes, East and West. London is Widian's first entry in the Sapphire Collection, and it nails the East-meets-West theme with aplomb. On the surface, a juicy raspberry and delicate floral petals are flanked by a lush cypress and leather accord. But the smoky, moody darkness of agarwood from the jungles of the Far East sweeps shadows underneath the freshness of this scene, tugging us away from London and towards the East. Its exotic mystery is deepened further by amber and musk that lends the scent a radiantly dry, sandy texture, turning our gaze to the red-gold desserts of the Arabian Peninsula.  Simultaneously reassuring and exciting, this fragrance is a fitting tribute to London, and the perfect vehicle to show what happens when Eastern exoticism meets Western polish. London truly is a winning proposition."," Oud, cypress, violet, lily of the valley, raspberry, leather, dry amber, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70912.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Buonissimo Eau de Parfum,1637,Hilde Soliani," Ask anyone what their fondest scent memory is, and chances are, the scent of baking bread will be invoked. For Luckyscent's 15th anniversary, our most inventive gourmand nose, Hilde Soliani, created her loveliest, most nostalgia-inducing scent, exclusively for us - Buonissimo. Imagine waking up in a charming Italian town over a simple breakfast of a hot cup of foamed cappuccino and a freshly baked sweet pastry. The fantastical Hilde brings this vision to life in the form of what the Italians call brioche- the fair lovechild between a flaky French croissant and clasically airy French brioche. It's perfectly buttery, and fluffy with a sugared vanilla. But it wouldn't be a Hilde Soliani without that how-did-she-do-that element, and here, she's captured the sweet egg wash over the pastries' gentle slopes, caramelized a crispy golden brown from the oven.  And don't forget - from beginning to end, like every proper Italian day, the dark swirl of espresso and cream is ever-present, lending its mature sophistication. This is a serious must have for any gourmand connoisseur.","vanilla, cream, cappuccino",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46639.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Boronia Eau de Parfum,2944,Grandiflora," Boronia is a very unusual fruity-floral composition based around a small, shrubby flower native to Western Australia, the eponymous boronia. Some varieties of the shrub can smell warm and woodsy, but this particular variety smells fruity and spicy, like a handful of ripe apricots dusted in cinnamon and lemon peel. There is even a minty freshness to the topnotes reminiscent of cassis leaf. The boronia also lends the perfume an ionone-rich feel, the silvery powder of violets and iris joining with a distinctive plum jam note to create an almost winey floral bouquet. The hay-like tones of a golden immortelle provide a textured backdrop to the florals, giving the scent a pleasantly rustic, early fall harvest feel: dried grass, hay, tobacco leaves turning to brown paper in the sun, and the dusty red earth of the Australian outback. Black tea and apricots create a suede impression, but it's a credit to the perfumer that the foodier notes of caramel, fruit, and cognac are never allowed to turn Boronia into a gourmand. It is fruity and rich, yes, but balanced by the tannic sharpness of tea and hay, the scent manages to stay elegantly dry. If you love the autumnal, plummy darkness of chypres such as Voleur de Roses and Mon Parfum Cheri Par Camille, then you will love Boronia too."," Boronia, green notes, apricot, woods, resins, cognac, floral notes, black tea, tobacco, suede, caramel",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64204.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambilux (formerly 50ml d'Ambiguite) Eau de Parfum,2800,Marlou," Ambilux is ambiguous only in the sense that it is puzzling that a list of largely plant-based spices, resins, and florals adds up to something so unapologetically animal. The first blast has our eyes rolling back in pleasure: a thickly furred musk redolent of warm animal, dripping tallow candles, and the salty skin of a loved one. That there are new perfumes out there that dare to challenge the great Muscs Khoublai Khan and Musc Tonkin is a pleasant surprise. Although Ambilux is quite different to these perfumes, it possesses the same earthy, no-holds-barred sensuality and a texture that is distinctly retro in its velvety thickness. The creator intended for this perfume to reflect the unique olfactory fingerprint we all carry, our own personal aroma, imprinting onto others as we touch, kiss, and make contact. But like its distant progenitor, L'Air de Rien, it also captures the smells of our nest: dusty spaces, books, pots overflowing with flowers, and old wood.  Despite the listed notes, what we predominantly pick up is a warm, oily sheep's wool nuance – waxy and lanolin-like, deeply inviting to the touch. Costus root is what gives the perfume its arousing animal fattiness, but it is used subtly here, woven into the other notes for an effect that is intimate but not uncomfortably close. The sweet, slippery feel of the woolen musk is cut with a bright, almost briny ylang note, aerating the heart with a salty breeze. In the drydown, castoreum gives us nuances of dry, smoky tobacco and leather. Ambilux captures all the grimy intimacy of our own bodies, our loved ones, and the crawl spaces of our inner sanctum: it's sexy, but also comfortable and elegant.     Update: Ambilux is a new version of the beloved 50ml d'Ambiguite, made a bit lighter, warmer, and more wearable while retaining all the animalic sensuality of the original.)"," Pink peppercorn, cumin, incense, ylang, dune plants, castoreum, costus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Grimoire Eau de Parfum,1800,Anatole Lebreton," A Grimoire: an ancient word for an ancient tome of spells, a sacred text, powerful in the right hands and dangerous in the wrong ones. Anatole Lebreton invites us to imagine such a volume, weathered by age and coated in dust, at the center of an overgrown cabin, invisible to all but the trained eye. An open window lets just the faintest sliver of light inside, along with the scents of green moss climbing the walls and a well-cultivated garden of herbs and spices, essential for the creation of magical objects. Dense clouds of incense dance in the light-beam, hinting at secrets unknowable, power as-of-yet untapped, waiting in a realm directly above and below our own. Warm, rich woods from the cabin walls and dusty paper from the pages of the book give rich body to the unique aroma inside, comforting but imposing, like a warm embrace you might never emerge from. An incense fragrance well beyond the confines of the modern world."," Bergamot, basil, lavender, elemi, olibanum, Atlas cedar, cumin, patchouli, moss, muscs",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Decay Of The Angel Eau de Parfum,1718,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes," This is a memorizing, burnt bouquet of exotic flowers inspired by Yukio Mishima's 1971 posthumously published novel, The Decay of The Angel. Like all of Timothy Han's creations, the highest level of natural ingredients are used here, and Han's artistic vision presents a smart,  deeply affecting fragrance that walks us through the 5 stages of a falling angel: decay, diaphoresis, dirt, dissatisfaction, and ultimately, darkness.Han's olfactive interpretation of an angelic fall starts with mandarin doused rose, ylang, and neroli. The fresh opening is contrasted with a heart of indolic jasmine, ripe and just starting to wilt. Its gloriously smoky base includes crisp frankincense along with smoldering cade, oud and cedar woods.Â  Patchouli, tonka and labdanum add a dimension of soft earthiness.A sensual intermingling of hedione and musk float throughout the charred dry-down, contrasting heavenly veneration and human desires.

Dryad Eau de Parfum,2029,Papillon Artisan Perfumes," Liz Moores, perfumer behind Papillon Perfumes, lives in a house deep inside the New Forest, surrounded by a menagerie of children, horses, and animals that she has rescued and nurtured. Given that the forest forms a protective ring around Liz and her animals, it makes sense that Dryad feels like her most personal perfume yet, inspired as it is by the nymphs said to dwell in oak trees according to Greek mythology. Dryad is a sylvan fantasy of friendly trees linking their branches together to form a sunlit, green canopy over your head. Although far sexier and more ruggedly outdoorsy than anything from Guerlain or Dior, fans of vintage Vol de Nuit and Miss Dior will still feel a thrill of recognition at Dyrad's damp, mossy heart of galbanum, narcissus and an overdose of genuine oakmoss. Smoky, tough galbanum and clary sage add a resinous, rubbery dry warmth to the moistness of the green heart, and there is a touch of sun-burnt hay by way of deer tongue, a plant rich in coumarin and vanilla, and often used to flavor tobacco. Costus and apricot add a sly hint of naughty inner thigh – but just a hint. Dryad is a shamanic, witchy, but also relaxed scent that coaxes open the rigidly classical lines of the classic green chypre, ushering in sunlight, herbs, and a bunch of bright aromatics. The result is a Green Goddess of a fragrance, and the first green chypre that belongs more in the forest than in the boardroom."," cedrat, bigaradier orange, bergamot, narcissus, oakmoss, jonquil, clary sage, orange blossom, lavender, orris, vetiver, thyme, galbanum, costus, tarragon, apricot, benzoin, peru balsam, styrax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'homme Accompli Eau de Parfum,1718,Divine," Yann Vasnier has done it again. A fresh, bone-dry masculine leather, L'Homme Accompli exudes quiet class from every pore. Opening on the classic snap of a Farina-style eau de cologne, the bristle of herbs and lemon soon dies back to reveal a musky, violet leaf-driven leather that will bring tears to the eyes of the vintage Fahrenheit lover. It is at once a familiar and elegant smell – signature scent worthy for the man who is sure of his place in the world. Bolstered by a musky Atlas cedar, L'Homme Accompli's leather accord has tremendous body and presence, while managing to skip all the sweet, gouty richness of modern masculine leathers. And it's that lightness of touch that makes this fragrance so special - the air and space that Vasnier has injected into its structure allows room to breathe. L'Homme Accompli grows ever drier and darker as time passes, the herbs and violet leather curling up under the smoke of styrax resin and guaiac wood, and finishing in a salty whisper of beach amber. If Cary Grant were a fragrance, he would be L'Homme Accompli."," Amber, leather, vetiver, guaiac wood, styrax, atlas cedar, violet, lemon, bergamot",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22716.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
White Madera Eau de Parfum,2803,Omnia Profumo," For years now, Omnia's Madera has been one of our reference gourmand scents- a sumptuous, mouthwatering butterscotch-vanilla-caramel delight that turns heads and entices those in its trail. Now, Omnia returns to one of their greatest hits with a fresh new take, supplementing the warm sweetness we love with a crisp, fresh, spicy new heart that ignites the senses and reinvents a classic. While the fragrance still opens with the instantly recognizable, positively sumptuous mix of vanilla bean and rich Madagascar vanilla, now it's also lightened and brightened with juicy, tart citrus. In the heart, the difference becomes even more clear, as licorice-y star anise and fiery cinnamon bring an intense, bright, and subtly masculine edge, while the soft florals of the original Madera still blend with the vanilla to provide smooth creaminess. And in the impossibly rich base, coconut and musk still join the party, keeping us firmly in gourmand territory. So is White Madera still Madera? Absolutely- the cozy, delectable vanilla you know and love is still very much present. But this is a new Madera, with a spicy, sophisticated, grown-up kick- and those seeking some energy with their comfort will not be disappointed."," Vanilla, citrus, peach blossom, floral notes, cinnamon, star anise, tobacco blossom, coconut, white musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cactus Azul Eau de Parfum,1395,Fueguia 1833," In a garden facing the sea of Uruguay,  a Cactus Flower discovers a corner to feel the soft coat of a sunbeam. Many fragrances are described as ""fresh, "" but that doesn't mean any old fresh scent possesses the kind of invigorating crispness that puts a buzz in your step and a smile on your face. Cactus Azul,  a delightful new offering from Fueguia,  delivers all that and more,  with a uniquely mouthwatering composition that blends floral,  herbal and woody elements for a lighter-than-air fragrance with surprisingly sexy substance. Clean,  heady cactus flowers evoke high-desert romanticism,  while a mouthwatering note of nanah mint (spearmint) shifts our gaze oceanside. Cedarwood,  fresh,  sharp and smooth,  gives backbone and a gently masculine touch. If any old generic fresh fragrance is all you're looking for,  this might not be the scent for you. But if you want a fresh,  vibrant scent that can truly turn heads,  Cactus Azul is an undeniable treasure."," Cactus flower, cedarwood, nanah mint",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62130.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chamber Eau de Parfum,1987,Fueguia 1833," Chamber's first perfume was created inspired by the thought of architecture, the analogy. Inspired by architect Louis Kahn's breathtaking, groundbreaking Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Chamber is a scent dedicated to exploring interior space, something it does with an impressively creative array of materials drawn from every level of the natural world, from the bottom of a vast lake to high above our heads. To represent the museum's abundance of concrete, marble, glass, grass and solar light, Chamber employs a fascinating blend of green, fresh, mineralic and spiced notes, notably fondo de lago, a collection of plant life harvested from the lake floor, which combines with tree moss and mate to deliver a sophisticated and unpredictable green scent with compelling depth and an emerging airiness evocative of the steady flow of light across the Kimbell's famed vaulted ceilings. Kahn's genius was to design a museum space that was at once imposing and welcoming, comfortable and beautiful, and as much a work of art as the treasures it would contain. With Chamber, we add yet another treasure to the Kimbell's collection."," Aquatic plants, Spanish moss, Mate",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62131.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Jacaranda Eau de Parfum,1016,Fueguia 1833," The jacaranda blossoms fall behind a misty window. An arpeggio played on a nineteenth-century guitar makes the beautiful silence disappear. From South Africa to Los Angeles, the jacaranda tree stands as an imposingly beautiful symbol of renewal- the brilliant purple blossoms appearing seemingly instantaneously, flooding city blocks with radiant color. These majestic trees are captured in all their gorgeous mystery in Jacaranda, a rich woody fragrance with the import and bearing of an ancient and noble forest. Deep, dark mahogany is interwoven with the freshness of spruce and the almost floral tones of rosewood for a complexity that recalls the exquisite finishes one might find in a master-quality violin, where power and precision combine. Lovers of deep, naturalistic wood scents, Jacaranda is your new obsession."," Rosewood, Mahogany, Spruce",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62132.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Muskara Phero J Eau de Parfum,1998,Fueguia 1833," An embodiment of the well-kept secret of desire. An elixir that connects the contemporary concept of a fragrance with ancient instincts and ancestry. Soft as skin and thrillingly sensual, Muskara Phero J uses a unique blend of plants from the Amazon region and distilled fragrant molecules to create an olfactory mask, an“anti-perfume” with a possessing ability to interact with the natural smell of the wearer. Ideal for adding a deeply sexy layer of musk to any other scent from the Fueguia collection and beyond, it's also a diabolical secret weapon worn all on its own- a seductive second skin you wouldn't notice until you were firmly in its clutches."," musks ""from the pheromone family""",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62133.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Quilombo Eau de Parfum,2662,Fueguia 1833," In colonial Brazil, Quilombos were synonymous of resistance and independence. Protected by a labyrinth of rivers and impenetrable forests, these fugitive worlds encapsulated an untouched tropical landscape. Mixing together native and African roots, a wild atmosphere emerged full of dances, rhythms and delicious flavours made from cupuacÃº and dulce de leche (a candied concentration made from burnt milk).  This is the scent of Quilombo, a mouthwatering treat that elevates the art of the milky gourmand beyond where we thought it could go. A sweet, creamy, ""how did they do that?""-level realistic hot milk accord wows our noses and tastebuds alike, while careful touches of vanilla and cane sugar supplement without overwhelming, keeping the composition specific and never in the realm of generic dessert scent. Long a symbol of hope, perseverance and joy in the face of oppression, Quilombos occupy an important place in Brazilian history. No matter your own personal battles, we think Quilombo can be a fragrance that offers some small element of these important concepts with each spray."," Vanilla, Pampa Milk, Cane Sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62134.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Thays Eau de Parfum,1868,Fueguia 1833," Passionate about native flora, Thays created unique parks. We have imagined the improbable encounters of multiple odors in his enchanting gardens. Originally born in France, Carlos Thays nevertheless was as true an Argentine as lived, with his landscape and park designs forming a significant and lasting element of Buenos Aires and beyond, parks that still have the capacity to enchant and amaze. To represent this in fragrance, Fueguia merges the delicate tones of mate flowers mingling with lush, creamy osmanthus and the vivid freshness of green tea. One sniff, and you're wandering the the Roman gardens of the Jardin Botanico, Thays' mansion ahead of you, lost in the natural splendor and in love with the world."," Mate flowers, Osmanthus, Green tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62135.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Cautiva Eau de Parfum,2762,Fueguia 1833," A heavenly musk laced with fruit and vanilla. La Cautiva means“The Captive”,  and it refers to an epic poem by Esteban Echeverria which is considered one of the first great works of modern Argentinian literature. This is an imaginative speculation about the scent of Mary, the main character, and while we have never read the poem, we can state unequivocally that she smelled delicious. This is airy and delectable – an enchanting confection that features a creamy whipped vanilla and a piercingly sweet black currant. The musk is soft spoken and warms to the skin as the edible elements come forward. Initially, there is a hint of syrup to the berries, but the intense sugar eases into a juicy, fresh currant with a hint of minty green leaves. As cloud-light and effortless as a meringue, topped with perfectly ripe berries - this is like a dessert you would eat in a dream.  The perfect warm weather gourmand."," Musk, blackcurrant, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Biblioteca de Babel Eau de Parfum,2201,Fueguia 1833," Cedar shelves, heavy leather bookbindings, vellum leaves, the smell of ink. The complex environment of an old book is brought to life. Named after a short story by Jorge Luis Borges, about an enormous library of interlocking rooms, housing a vast collection of books – this fragrance is about the intoxicating scent of an old library where the books have been kept impeccably dry. It is a combination of warm woods, leather bindings, and a hint of ink. The strongest element here is absolutely the wood – warm, reassuring cedar and a South American wood called cabreuva, which complements the cedar.  This is deep, burnished and luxurious. The first impression is waxy and surprisingly sweet. There is a rich tuberose-like note, like a flower pressed between the pages, and a dusting of cinnamon. Than we get the soft, worn leather of book bindings, the dry spiciness of old vellum and  a trace of tobacco. This is like the warm, comforting embrace of a favorite armchair, in a book-lined room. An instant favorite – we would love to spend a long time in this library."," Cedar, cabreuva (woody note), cinnamon",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Panthea Eau de Parfum,1302,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," How do you picture the scent of heaven? Forget about the specificity of religion, and focus only on the general concept: a pearly-white paradise above the clouds, clean and enveloping, mysterious yet sublimely blissful. This is the scent of Panthea, a fresh, feminine, iris-driven addition to the 777 series imbued with an almost transcendent sense of grace. Pathea opens with an energetic sense of freshness, balancing the gentle juiciness of tangerine against the sparkle of pink pepper with a sweepingly smooth white tea providing a pristine backdrop. The heart of iris has plenty of compelling powdery floral character, but also a softness that eschews rooty or earthy tones in favor of delightfully lush white florals and muskiness. A delicate balance of light woods, tonka and patchouli lend longevity without bulk- the scent is weightless throughout. Spend a day in the clouds with Panthea- we doubt you'll ever want to come back to earth."," Bergamot, pink pepper, tangerine, elemi, white tea, carrot, iris, jasmine, violet, carnation, white musk, tobacco flower, tonka, sandalwood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Wish Come True Eau de Parfum,1663,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," Sweet and shimmering, lush and enveloping, Wish Come True is a mystical potion perfect for any and all who know you're never too old to believe in magic. Crafted around a gorgeous symphony of citrus, florals and vanilla, Stephane Humbert Lucas' latest journey to faraway lands leads not to the palaces and oases of the Middle East, but to Avalon itself, a world of sweet enchantments and illusions that may be more real than our own reality. Wish Come True opens with fresh, bright citrus brushed with sweet ylang and enveloped in powder, like a ray of sunlight through a gentle fog. A supernatural tuberose, both fresh and voluptuous, lies amidst a bed of hypnotic incense and ambergris, with a rich vein of labdanum and vanilla coating every surface, drawing us ever further into the beautiful surrealism.  Enchanting, creative and prosaic, Wish Come True is a new journey into mythical lands- one you won't want to miss."," Tangerine, bergamot, ylang-ylang, labdanum, incense, jasmine, ambergris, tuberose, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65514.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
MEM Eau de Parfum,2707,Bogue Profumo," Not since AimÃ¨ Guerlain created Jicky in 1889 has a perfumer done something so radical to lavender. Antonio Gardoni takes the sunny herb from its kitchen garden setting and passes it through clay, wood, minerals, burned sugar, and wax so that a new form emerges, like steel forged by the elements. MEM contains all the hallmark Bogue signatures but represents a clear step forward in complexity even from the masterpiece that is Maai.MEM opens up on a dark lavender note that smells less like fresh herbs and more like clay and cepes. Sunshine soon arrives in the form of hops, toasted malt, and the pale ale fizz of aldehydes, lifting the scent out of its humus-rich opening. The scorched-sugar of ethyl maltol caramelizes the lavender, creating a phantom accord of fruit like the dark, almost calcified contents of a forgotten jar of peach marmalade. But as soon as the mind adjusts to this accord, MEM shifts again, this time into a rich floral heart of jasmine, rose, and ylang ylang that sacrifices prettiness for the more interesting facets of wax, gasoline, and rubber. Indian sandalwood with its wheaten milkiness and Himalayan cedarwood with its lingering note of woodsmoke work in tandem to ease the florals and aromatics into the base. The drydown, which is sturdy and beautiful, weaves the sweet dust of unlit incense into the musky, salty, animalic base of a barbershop fougere. MEM is not a perfume that lends itself to easy interpretation, it will reward your patience a hundred times over. In terms of who can wear it, MEM is something of a chimera: sometimes it seems masculine, at others, feminine. Beautiful, quixotic, and memorable, we think this is artisanal perfumery at its most daring."," Petitgrain, mandarin, grapefruit, lavender (4 different species), ylang ylang, lily of the valley, white champaca, jasmine grandiflorum, rose damascena, bourbon geranium, vanilla, peppermint, laurel, Siam benzoin, rosewood, sandalwood, Himalayan cedarwood, labdanum, ambergris, musk, castoreum, civet, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66921.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Delma Eau de Parfum,2672,Widian," The Dalma Island lies just off the coast of Abu Dhabi.  It's known for its pearl trade and famous for its pearl divers and legends of buried treasure left behind by ""pearl pirates.""     Widian uses the images and stories of Dalma Island as inspiration for one of its softest, sweetest compositions yet. Leather and marshmallow shape a base that is as delicious as it is fresh. It creates the foundation for Delma's creaminess, which never crosses fully into the gourmand category,  but rather is contrasted by resinous guaiac and fresh green galbanum. The peach-laced floral heart of the composition is balanced by a dusting of saffron and nutmeg. Delma's contrasting notes are masterfully blended into the olfactive equivalent of the smooth, iridescent texture of a pearl.  Shimmering, sweet and irresistible."," Mandarin, peach, bergamot, heliotrope, jasmine, freesia, geranium, nutmeg, patchouli, saffron, leather, woody notes, marshmallow",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70909.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Liwa Eau de Parfum,2306,Widian," The Liwa oasis is a lush valley of date palm farms and Bedouin villages in the middle of a seemingly endless sea of sand. Its improbable beauty is the inspiration behind Widian's newest fragrance, a gorgeously modern oriental that perfectly blends stylish florals with exotic spice. Liwa evokes the oasis with lush jasmine, creamy amber, and sandalwood surrounded by dry saffron, wafting smoke and a powdery patchouli and vetiver base. It's a perfectly balanced combination of heady powdery spice and smoke with creamy sweet white florals and ambers. Like its namesake, Liwa is a hidden treasure, waiting to be discovered."," Jasmine, saffron, bergamot, artemisia, amber, white rose, geranium, cedar, patchouli, sandalwood, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70910.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aqaysos Eau de Parfum,1793,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection," What is the scent of crystalline wood? This concept,  of the strange geometry that might exist somewhere between nature's most versatile material and one of it's most fascinatingly exact,  is what inspired Pierre Guillaume to create Aqaysos,  a scent which casts a fascinatingly illusive prism that alternates between spicy,  fruity and woody notes. The result is an elusive,  versatile and sneakily powerful fragrance that wears like a suave,  modern,  and refreshing take on a certain wildly popular fruit-inflected masculine. Which isn't to say Aqaysos is another dull Aventus knockoff. In fact,  quite the opposite- while the juicy,  explosively fresh lime and bergamot opening is sure to delight,  it's cut with an aromatic dose of coriander,  lending a metallic quality to it,  at once mathematically precise and yet intriguingly otherworldly. A unique heart of little-used sansho berry,  with its lemon-peppery spiciness,  adds fiery depth to the sweet,  juicy blackcurrant. And growing ever stronger as it dries,  a robustly woodsy and musky base is given subtly bitter power with a dose of cocoa bean,  which asserts itself in unexpected rhythms. Lovers of fresh,  fruit-and-wood driven masculine scents will surely find a new go-to with Aqaysos. But this fascinatingly complex crystal palace hides secrets all its own.A first for the Huitieme Art collection,  Aqaysos is presented in a unique ""Shadow Flacon, "" with the iconic Parfumerie Generale silhouette blacked out by an interior ceramic coating."," Lime, coriander, blackcurrant, sansho berry, woods, musks, cocoa beans",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/54516.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Il Tempo delle Mele Eau de Parfum,1363,Hilde Soliani," Ask what region has the best food in Italy and you're bound to hear some profound disagreements- after all, we're talking about the gastronomic center of the universe- but we'd be willing to bet that Emilia-Romagna comes up more often than most. The northern region that contains Bologna, Modena, and Parma is certainly a culinary powerhouse, one that Parma native Hilde Soliani has visited in her work before, but with Il Tempo delle Melle, her ode to Emilia-born chef Igles Corelli, Soliani opts for a simple, mouthwatering local delicacy- the torta di mele ferrarrese, a basic but luscious apple cake enjoyed by everyone from kids to grandparents. But as Hilde's to-die-for gourmands have always taught us, simple doesn't have to mean boring, and Il Tempo, with its vibrant, juicy tart apple, creamy vanilla, and warm, mouthwateringly lactic milk note that emerges more and more as the fragrance dries. While we weren't lucky enough to grow up in Emilia-Romagna, this scent nevertheless has a Proustian nostalgia to it, evoking images of warm family gatherings overlooking the Adriatic. Just this once, you're allowed to skip dinner and go straight to dessert."," Milk, apple, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46633.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hot Milk Eau de Parfum,1879,Hilde Soliani," What, exactly, is Hot Milk? One sniff and you'll realize that's not an easy question to answer. Sure, there's an intensely electric burst of resinous black pepper, nose-tingling cinnamon, and even an undercurrent of insidiously scalding chili oil, but leave it to Hilde Soliani to balance all of that firepower on top of a pitch-perfect milk note that soothes the spirit and ignites our sense of childhood with a wondrously cool creaminess. And what do those two opposite elements add up to? It seems like each time we put it on our skin, we pick up yet another facet- sometimes the energetic pepper dominates, other times the smooth gourmand aspects, and often still the two synthesize into something that resembles a rich, fascinating woodsiness. What we do know for sure- this is undeniably a Hilde scent."," Milk, hot pepper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46634.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Carnicure (formerly L'animal sauvage) Eau de Parfum,2202,Marlou," Wow. Carnicure is one naughty little kitty. In case you've been looking for it, Carnicure is the sweet spot between the ferocious dirtiness of Serge Lutens Muscs Kublai Khan, the smutty florals of Kiehl's, and the milky innocence of Helmut Lang EDP. In other words, this one is not only gorgeous, not only elegant, but above all exceedingly sexy.A brief flash of flowers - orange blossom and violet – set the mood for passion, and before we know it we're lying on a massive bed piled high with animal pelts in front of an open fire in an ancient castle. The deep, civety funk of the fur mingles with the smells of desire- salt, sweat, skin, and human fur. But an echo of the sugared flower petals and milky sandalwood still glows through the haze of musk, gently suggestive of the comfort of a lovers' bathing ritual. Innocence lost, and then regained – over and over again. This right here is the smell of human intimacy.Update: Carnicure is a new and improved version of the L'animal sauvage, slightly reworked to deliver a newly focused base that incorporates touches of vanilla, sandalwood, ambergris, and labdanum. It's slightly less fruity than the original, but its deeply sensual spirit is unchanged."," Orange blossom, violet, sandalwood, patchouli, civet, vanilla, sandalwood, musk, ambergris, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Passion Eau de Parfum,1855,M. Micallef," In the throes of true passion, there is no room for hesitation, self-consciousness or restraint- only inspiration. M. Micallef's newest creation is a true representation of that fervor, a vivid sensory rush of juicy fruits, fiery spices and deep, rich woods that combines for a euphoric, luxurious fragrance experience unlike any other. Bold, mouthwatering orange washes over a smooth, caramel-inflected oud with spikes of cinnamon and deep, gourmand patchouli, creating a vibrant and romantic ode to love and artistry. The brilliant, eye-catching gold bottle only increases the compelling sensuality, promising that Passion will be the centrepiece of any collection. Give yourself over to Passion- we're certain you'll come away more than satisfied."," Orange, cinnamon, cashmeran, caramel, benzoin, sandalwood, musk, patchouli, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24554.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rahele Eau de Parfum,1430,Neela Vermeire Creations," Over the course of the mid-1600s, three intrepid Frenchmen- named Bernier, Tavernier and ThÃ©venot- ventured separately into the heart of Mughal India, seeking fortune, adventure, discovery and opportunity. Their multitude of experiences, from serving in the royal court to trading for the legendary Tavernier (Hope) Diamond, become three individual travelogues, which thrilled and educated audiences back in Europe and informed centuries of European obsession with Eastern art and culture. Rahele (""Traveler""), the newest fragrance from Neela Vermeire, is a gorgeously smooth and breathtakingly rich new floral that honors these travelers with an elegant Euro-style chypre that pulses with Indian spice and exotic floral life. Cardamom and cinnamon inject vibrant energy into smooth, powdery violet and iris, while rich, creamy osmanthus wraps around lush rose to evoke grand baroque fashion with a sensual caress of lusciously soft leather. By bringing their Indian experiences to the French masses, Bernier, Tavernier and ThÃ©venot brought the world closer together. Now, with Rahele, their accomplishments are yet again given vivid new life."," Green mandarin, cardamom, cinnamon, violet leaf, osmanthus, rose, magnolia, jasmin, iris, violet, cedar, sandalwood, oakmoss, patchouli, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56507.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sweet Parmesan Violet Eau de Parfum,2846,Hilde Soliani," Life in Hilde Soliani's hometown of Parma, Italy, is possibly as close to paradise on Earth as one can get. The gorgeous, historic streets thrum with vibrant but never crowded pedestrian energy (and the occasional hometown-founded Lamborghini), the culture is relaxed yet saturated with the contributions of some of the world's most renowned artists, composers and designers, and the wine, cheese, and prosciutto are the best in all of the country. To honor this remarkable city, Hilde Soliani created Sweet Parmesan Violet, a delectable confection inspired by her native city's predilection for eating the petals of the native-grown Violetta di Parma with a dusting of sugar as a sweet treat. One whiff, and we are whisked away to the Piazza Garibaldi, marveling at the historic walls of the Palazzo del Governatore and savoring the sugary pop of smooth, powdery violet, feeling the relaxation wash over us. Obviously, the best way to feel the satisfaction of Parmesan life is to buy a one-way ticket and never look back. But Sweet Parmesan Violet is more than enough to hold us over for now."," Violet, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46631.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Una Tira l'Altra Eau de Parfum,1895,Hilde Soliani," Summertime in Italy means long, languid days of relaxation and banter, lounging in sunshine and watching the world go by. There's wine, of course (always wine), but on the hottest days, real Italians rich for the Luxardo, a rich cherry liqueur with mouthwatering flavour and a surprising bite. Una Tira l'Altra is single-minded in its recreation of this liqueur, resulting in a fragrance that, while straightforward, conceals endless complexity of fruit-drenched flavour. These cherries are sweet and syrupy, juicy and fruity, tart and boozy, revealing different aspects in unexpected combinations as it casually stretches itself off the skin. For a particularly indulgent treat, you can even do as the Italians would and pour it over creamy gelato- or in this case, layer it atop Soliani's mouthwatering Crema di Latte. Our new holy grail cherry is here, and we're positively intoxicated.", Cherry,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46632.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Orange Intense Eau de Parfum,1512,Fragrance du Bois," A beautiful rendering of a dark chocolate Mounds bar in perfume form. The opening notes of Oud Orange Intense are smoky and nutty, bringing to mind a pile of coconut husks smoldering in the ashes of a fire. Creamy musks and bourbon vanilla bring a cocoa-tinted softness to the mix, restraining the beachy exuberance of the coconut, and also its sweetness. What emerges is a dry, woody vanilla with a luxuriously boozy touch, like a log of driftwood rubbed lightly with coconut liquor. The oud note here is less of a headlining note than a calming influence on the other notes. Its austere woodiness turns what could have been a full-on, coconutty tropical extravaganza into an adult woody vanilla. Oud Orange Intense is both a surprise and a triumph."," Coconut, fruits, bourbon vanilla, oud, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Noir Intense Eau de Parfum,2706,Fragrance du Bois," Unlike the majority of orientals called“intense” or“noir”, Oud Noir Intense actually lives up to its name. Weaving jasmine and roses into a brocade of pure, smoky oud, sandalwood, musk, and spices, the result is an incredibly rich, potent perfume that feels like it should be kept in a ceremonial chamber for anointing the temples and robes of Emirati royals. The fragrance is complex but so expertly blended that each note feels like an extension of the next: spicy florals, creamy musks, animalic oud oil, smoky-sweet resins, and earthy patchouli all swirled together like cream through a cup of black coffee. A dark and mesmerizing fragrance that represents the very pinnacle of oriental and Arabic perfumery."," bergamot, cardamom, rose, jasmine, sandalwood, saffron, patchouli, vanilla, musk, amber, pure agarwood (oud)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sahraa Oud Eau de Parfum,2523,Fragrance du Bois," Despite its desert inspiration, Sahraa Oud is a perfume that is as placidly, richly golden as a piece of Bvlgari costume jewelry. Featuring a large dollop of the real oud oil that Fragrance du Bois sources directly from its plantations in Asia, its soft but feral aroma is cushioned by layers of sweet, orangey amber, sandalwood, and roses – essentially a dab of oud buried deep within the folds of Fendi's Theorema.  Warm, soft, and almost waxy in its roundness, this is a scent that gives off the satiny glow of an aged wine. A touch of inky moss and spicy saffron lends Sahraa Oud a chypre touch, giving the waxy amber a faintly bitter, pleasing bite, like the patina on old wood. Rather than the desert, Sahraa Oud brings us to a backstreet in Tokyo, its velvety darkness lit by strings of glowing red and orange lanterns."," rose, geranium, jasmine, moss, patchouli, sandalwood, saffron, vanilla, amber, pure oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
London Oud Eau de Parfum,2910,Fragrance du Bois," Too good not to share! That's what former World Heavyweight Boxing Champion David Haye, said to Fragrance du Bois when they handed him this originally bespoke fragrance. So they unleashed it on the world, and boy, are we glad. Composed to reflect the exciting mix of cultures and stories of the city Haye loves, London Oud is a true melting pot of a fragrance that pulls together opposing elements that you'd think won't work together but absolutely do. The aromatic freshness of spearmint, lemon, and lavender adds lift and movement to the spicy, dark woodiness of the oud oil, and the whole thing is shot through with sparkling marine notes. An aquatic oud fragrance? An unusual approach but we find this fragrance utterly convincing – it's a great marriage of land (oud) and sea (aquatics) that proves that diversity truly is the spice of life."," lemon, bergamot, mint, lavender, jasmine, white flowers, marine notes, patchouli, cedar, nutmeg, cardamom, pure agarwood (oud)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Jaune Intense Eau de Parfum,2070,Fragrance du Bois," Wow! One hit of Oud Jaune Intense and we are floating in away in a pool of tropical island bliss, our senses lulled by the heady aroma of pikake and gardenia petals soaking in coconut oil. This is one big-bosomed island girl of a perfume and we love it. Juicy pineapple and monoi oil form a fruity, creamy grin that lifts the corners of the scent at both ends. Oud? It's there, but only in homeopathic doses, tethering that big yellow balloon of tropical flowers to a woody, slightly smoky backbone. Ylang and jasmine bring some earthy, spicy gravitas to the pool party, but lascivious orange blossom turns up the heat. It ends, as all great parties should, with a big mug of warm vanilla milk before bed."," Tahitian gardenia, ylang-ylang, pineapple, jasmine, orange blossom, oud, vanilla, lactones, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Bleu Intense Eau de Parfum,2750,Fragrance du Bois," Oud Bleue Intense does indeed have a strangely“blue” vibe to it. Bracing and intense, its mixture of marine air, earth, truffles, and ozone is simply intoxicating. Opening with an earthy, fungal myrrh fused with oily sandalwood, the scent picks up spice in the form of nutmeg and cardamom but retains that cool tone. A bright mandarin note weaves it way through the resins and spices, keeping things as fresh as a Mediterranean breeze. The citrus, myrrh, and spices continue to dominate well into the heart, where they merge smoothly with a rich, balsamic amber. In what has become a signature of Fragrance du Bois, the pure oud oil in this composition is deployed as a unifying balm to knit all the other elements together rather than to stand out on its own. If you're wary of oud but love fresh, spicy, balsamic ambers, then give this one a try. It's superb."," Cardamom, nutmeg, mandarin, frankincense, labdanum, myrrh oil, amber, pure oud oil, sweet myrrh, styrax, benzoin, myrrh resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75707.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Rouge Intense Eau de Parfum,1528,Fragrance du Bois," There is something incredibly sexy about Oud Rouge Intense. At first glance, the notes seem minimalistic. But put it on warm skin and it comes alive, the bright, spicy pepper and lemon mingling with the musky cedar and dry, aromatic sandalwood to create a scent that will leave people wondering if you're wearing perfume or if your skin just smells that amazing. Imagine making love in the middle of a forest, your skin, sweat, and hair mingling with the soil, wood dust, and ion-charged air, and that's what this smells like. The woods play off each other in a subtly exciting way: the musky, slight bitter cedar adding muscle, the sandalwood a lactic creaminess, and the pure oud oil a smoky, medicinal depth that feels as old as time itself. Lovers of aromatic, spicy woods – your ship has come in."," Pink pepper, lemon, cedar, patchouli, sandalwood, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Verde di Persia Parfum Concentration,1924,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," Mouthwateringly sweet, vibrantly warm, Verde di Persia is a blast of summer air with enough zest and energy to heat up even the chilliest fall or winter day. Delectably juicy cassis and green apple combine with bracingly green davana and sweet, creamy osmanthus and pistachio flower for a naturally fruit-laden delight, while amber, musk and patchouli bring a dry and intense breeze reminiscent of the height of summertime, compellingly intense and evocative. It's a divine escape, one we're delighted to find works perfectly in every temperature, a scent that brings summertime vibes all year around.

20 Years Eau de Parfum,2527,M. Micallef," Twenty years ago, Martine Micallef, Geoffrey Nejman and Jean Claude Astier introduced a brand that would set the high standard for how luxury niche fragrance should look, feel, present and smell. Now, as they celebrate their 20th anniversary, M. Micallef has released a new Les Exclusifs scent inspired by a renewed drive for travel and exploration, a modern gourmand that borrows expertly from M. Micallef's rich history of elegant florals and mouthwatering gourmands, while also incorporating the sophisticated and spicy exoticism that has shown up in their more recent work. The result is a fragrance that sums up the best of what this iconic brand has to offer, while also proving that the wondrous creativity of this team is as fresh as ever.20 Years opens with precious notes of white rose and transparent jasmine, fresh, lush and romantic, which reveal subtly sweet and herbaceous davana and rich, gorgeous orange blossom. Micallef's signature gourmand touch soon sweeps us away on a tide of delectable caramel, faceted with earthy-sweet patchouli and precious woods, buffered with impossibly creamy vanilla. As lusciously beautiful as the scent is the bottle, which adds a new element to the famous Les Exclusifs design with a subtly reptile-inspired outer cover that evokes change and transformation. Warm, sensual, elegant and complex, 20 Years is a celebration of all that M. Micallef has accomplished, and a sign that the next few decades are more promising still."," Bergamot, nutmeg, exotic fruit, white rose, davana, orange flower, jasmine, geranium, patchouli, caramel, vanilla, precious wood, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24552.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gold I Parfum Extrait,1895,Widian," Powerful, opulent and smooth, Gold I is a new standard of luxury for Widian by AJ Arabia that more than lives up to the prestige of its name. Inspired not only by the lavish oud and amber blend that permeates the composition, but also by the historic journey that these most precious materials once made along the ancient trading routes of Asia, Gold I is a radiant, sensual amber oud both striking and intensely personal. Gold I opens with fresh spiciness, the vibrant zing of pepper balanced with crisp, juicy apple to invigorate and stimulate. A soft, white floral heart quickly adds smooth sensuality, while the powerful oud exudes both romance and impressive strength. A sweet base of musky, woodsy amber only furthers the deep complexity, coaxing you into a dreamlike state that lingers for untold hours. The luxury of Widian by AJ Arabia has been evident in every precious creation the house has ever made, but with the swirling amber richness of Gold I, the bar has been spectacularly raised."," Apple, pepper, white flowers, oud, vanilla, musk, sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70905.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Queen Of The Night Eau de Parfum,2080,Grandiflora," With unique insight Bertrand Duchaufour has thrown a noose The Selenicereus Grandiflorus, or Queen of the Night, is a rare cactus with a dramatic feature- it blooms but once a year, for a single night, with a fragrance so uniquely beautiful that it has been the stuff of legend for centuries. With this inspiration, Bertrand Duchaufour and Grandiflora have delivered a fragrance that not only captures the devastating beauty of this remarkable plant, but also the poetically fluid nature of its transformation, a captivating mix of memory and desire. Impossible to unravel, the floral bouquet opens fresh, bright and lightly fruity, gaining lushness and vibrancy by the moment before dawn's light sees the florals slowly recede into a gentle base with delicate woodsy and powdery tones. As with the fleeting bloom it so perfectly represents, Queen of the Night is sensual, compelling and evocatively bittersweet- a tale of love without regret."," Citrus, berries, clove, orange blossom, jasmine sambac, ylang ylang, tuberose, gardenia, pittosporum, wisteria, mimosa, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64203.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cafe Chantant Parfum Extrait,1900,Nobile 1942," The ""Singing CafÃ©s"" of the Belle Ã‰poque- renowned venues of theatre, song and drink that played a major role in the revitalization of Paris in the late 19th century. Artists, socialites and revelers of every social strata flocked to these magical establishments in droves, cultivating an optimism and cultural explosion of unparalleled energy. With CafÃ© Chantant, Nobile 1942 pays tribute to the unique atmosphere of the Singing CafÃ©, from the elegant chypres worn by fashionable ladies, to the rich tobacco smoke of their gentleman companions, and even the delicacies on the tables and in the cocktail glasses, for a fragrance of rich, creamy, aromatic depth.CafÃ© Chantant opens with a juicy burst of sweet black cherry and mouthwatering spice, immediately enveloping us in a world of heady liquors and exotic delights. A powdery floral heart of heliotrope and iris recalls the exquisite cosmetics and larger than life fragrances of years past, while a base of deeply creamy vanilla and rich, musky patchouli and benzoin swoons with an atmosphere both sultry and gourmand. The overall effect is complex, evocative and dreamlike- a window into an incomparably glamorous past."," Black cherry, laurel, anise, heliotrope, altea, iris, benzoin, vanilla, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52318.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Taklamakan Eau de Parfum,1792,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," Dark and sultry, dry and sweet, Taklamakan ripples like the sands of the desert for which it was named, engulfing you in an addictive cloud of smoky vanilla, luxurious caramel, richly spiced patchouli, and sumptuously balsamic resins under skies heavy with ambergris. Hot, dry desert winds blow from the east, bringing exotic luxuries from the ancient Spice Route, incense and opoponax, and setting ablaze a rich cadre of woods consisting of Chinese cedar, birch, cade, and guaiac. As they slowly envelop the dark vanilla at Taklamakan's heart, dusty myrrh and sweet myrrh cast their magic in a haunting spell that is made all the richer by opulent sandalwood, luxuriously creamy tonka, chewy labdanum, and a drop of dry rose. In its drydown, Taklamakan becomes a comforting dream of golden amber infused with creamy plushness, dry woods, velvety resins, and soft spiciness. Powerful, deep, and long-lasting, Taklamakan entranced us with its sweet desert song, and has become a new favorite from Stephane Humbert Lucas."," Bergamot, rose, patchouli coeur, black vanilla, tonka absolute, birch, cade, gaiac, cedar, myrrh, orris, tolu balsam, labdanum, ambreine, amber gris, benzoin, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65512.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
"Eye, Hatshepsut Eau de Parfum",1604,Charenton Macerations," Eye, Hatshepsut is an olfactive homage to one of history's most notable gender rebels: Pharaoh Hatshepsut of Egypt. A warrior, a visionary, a pioneer... she is most remembered for her enduring ability to rewrite the narrative of history in her favor: a mythical legacy forever emblazoned into the walls of her temple at Dayr al-Bahri. The structure of the fragrance takes inspiration from the many depictions of Hatshepsut as a female figure in male dress. It juxtaposes softer, sweeping floral arcs of lotus and iris with starker, contrasting resinous edges of kohl and kyphi, blending elements of strength and beauty together against the crystalline backdrop of the Saharan sands."," Papyrus, blue lotus, smoke, burnt tallow, kohl, cinnamon, honeyed wine, orris butter, patchouli, incense, labdanum, Egyptian musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67303.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Perdizione Eau de Parfum,2068,Nobile 1942," Being lost isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes it's liberating to completely let yourself go, to give in utterly to pleasure and let the tides of delight carry you where they will. That's exactly what Nobile 1942 had in mind when they created Perdizione, a lusciously rich tempest of sweet florals whipped up in a compellingly smooth, creamy layer of musks and woods that makes our heads spin and our mouths water. Bright and sensual neroli and sweet ylang blend with elegant jasmine, while a creamy vanilla sweeps in like a monsoon and envelops everything in a blissful haze where down is up and time and space lose meaning. We may not know where we're going once we're lost in Perdizione. But we're in no rush to find out."," Grapefruit, bergamot, lavender, ylang-ylang, rose, orange blossom, neroli petitgrain, cedar, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52317.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sandalo Nobile Eau de Parfum,1441,Nobile 1942," We've always loved Nobile 1942, but the venerable Italian house has been on a particular tear lately, releasing a series of inspired scents that pull off the impressive feat of being as wearable as they are strikingly original. So when we say that Sandalo Nobile is as comfortable and easy to wear as any sandalwood in recent memory, that's not faint praise- spicy yet smooth, robustly textured yet soft-spoken, Sandalo Nobile is a deliciously woodsy treat for the senses. Think of it as a just-stronger-than-skin scent that even the manliest of men could wear with confidence. Sandalo Nobile opens with a rich tapestry of spices, where fiery cumin and mouthwatering saffron open the palate to a buttery iris that seals in the near-gourmand elements just in time for the woods to emerge. And what a blend of woods it is- lightly green fig tree, peppery gurjum, fresh cedar, and the star of the show, a sandalwood both creamy and robust, velvety smooth, and humming with quiet power. Looking for an everyday sandalwood scent that doesn't believe that discretion is the opposite of personality? Nobile 1942 has just what you need."," Saffron, cumin seed, iris, fig wood, gurjum, sandalwood, benzoin, white musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52316.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
On The Road Eau de Parfum,2088,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes," Like the Kerouac original, On The Road is a modern travelogue classic with attitude and style to spare. The story begins with intense, smoky notes of benzoin and birch, reminiscent of the hot asphalt and grittiness of New York City. As we wind across the country, our journey takes us through the openness of the dusty cornfields of a Mid-Western America, punctuated by forays into smoky tobacco filled jazz bars, and eventually rising to the cedar forests of a Pacific Coast. The restlessness of the journey finally gives way to a bright-eyed optimism left by the fresh green fragrance of galbanum, citrus and bergamot. With this dynamic, vibrant followup to She Came To Stay, Timothy Han solidifies his reputation for smart, complex natural perfumery with literary style to spare."," Galbanum, lemon, bergamot, lavandin, amyris, cedarwood, patchouli, tonka bean, oakmoss, gaiac, benzoin, birch, vanilla, labdanum, perou",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black V Parfum Extrait,1676,Widian," Bold yet sophisticated, luscious yet playful, Black V is a snappy, vivacious, and utterly lovely floral-driven parfum extrait that recalls the verve, vigor and creativity of the 1920's. Black V opens with a blast of energy, combining spicy cinnamon with crisp, tart lemon peel and juicy peach. In the sumptuous heart of the fragrance, narcotic tuberose is given a natural vibrancy with lightly bitter orange blossom and a bright solar accord, leading into a rich but never heavy base of warm cedar, smooth vanilla, and a dollop of sweet caramel. All of Widian's wondrous fragrances combine the best of east and west; we're thrilled to report that Black V also includes a tantalizing, joyful mix of past and present."," Lemon, peach, cinnamon, tuberose, orange blossom, solar accord, cedar, caramel, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70904.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Incarnata Eau de Parfum,2771,Anatole Lebreton," Ravishingly, unapologetically sexy, Incarnata is the fragrance, quite literally, of a goddess incarnate- a supernaturally powerful feminine presence made flesh and blood. Opening with a fiercely vibrant splash of fruit and florals, Incarnata thrums with sensual energy from the very first impression. A lushly feminine heart is dominated by a captivating lipstick note, both immediately identifiable and surprising in its smooth, lightly powdery depth- lovers of Malle's Lipstick Rose can expect to meet their new obsession. A warm base featuring myrrh, amber, and Lebreton's delicate suede note wrap you in a close embrace, completing a seduction that's all but irresistible. For any woman unafraid to make a serious impression, Incarnata is a true force of nature."," Raspberry, violet, rhododendron, lipstick, iris, myrrh, rose, amber, suede, benzoin, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Haine Eau de Parfum,1262,Moth and Rabbit," A contemporary black and white masterpiece directed by Mathieu Kassovitz's, the film is set in a banlieue (government housing project) outside of Paris. In 24 hours, the movie provides a passage way into the lives of a mixed-race young male trio, consumed with the hatred fueled by police brutality and racial conflict. The fragrance was created to capture specific moments of aggression and tension in the film with smells of a cold blade, polished gun steel and the burning from riots and rubber from drive by shootings. Built around these elements are the scent of concrete and the septic environmental smells that fill the walls of government housing projects."," aldehyde, buchu leaf, bay, birch, cedar, metallic accord, leather, moss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Madagascan Jasmine Eau de Parfum,1683,Grandiflora," Inspired by the Stephanotis Floribunda, an asterid treasured above normal star jasmine for its unique aroma and used frequently in high-end bridal bouquets, Madagascan Jasmine is a floral fragrance as unique and captivating as its namesake. A true soliflore, Madagascan Jasmine beautifully captures the complexity of Stephanotis, which far surpasses the amorphous sweetness of lesser jasmines, presenting a floral both lusciously white and deeply green, fresh and yet heady, with a boldness appropriate for both the ingredient and the dynamic florist responsible for the Grandiflora line. Eschewing obvious choices, Madagascan Jasmine does not open with rote citrus notes, choosing instead to delve into the stemmy, green notes that represent the fullness of the Stephanotis plant, leading into the rich petals of the heart notes. A touch of waxiness further represents the skin of the petals, while a barely-there woodsiness fortifies without distracting. The Madagascan Jasmine is a flower of unique sophistication and import. We're pleased to announce that its fragrance is all of that and more.","jasmine, citrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64202.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Danza delle Libellule Exceptional Edition Parfum Extrait,2807,Nobile 1942," Since we added La Danza delle Libellule to our store last year, we've been overwhelmed with the response- it turns out a lot of people out there are just as swept away as we are by its gorgeous, whimsically feminine combination of sweet fruits, creamy vanilla and playful spices. In fact, just like many others, we've loved La Danza so much that we find ourselves wanting more. Which is why we're so pleased to announce the Exceptional Edition, a sumptuous Parfum Extrait that captures everything we love about the original Eau de Parfum in a gorgeously rich 35% concentration. Now, the red apple is juicier and sweeter, the cinnamon spicier, the vanilla warmer, creamier and butterier, all with a sillage and longevity that last for countless wondrous hours. When we reviewed the original La Danza, we called it the kind of fragrance that you'd wear just to treat yourself. With the Exceptional Edition, that treat just got all the more delightfully indulgent."," Bergamot, red apple, cedar, cinnamon, musk, vanilla, coconut",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52314.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Salome Eau de Parfum,1329,Papillon Artisan Perfumes," Close the blinds and send the kids to bed- Salome, the latest sensation from Papillon Artisan Perfumes, is Sexy with a grown-up, capital ""S""-- a swooningly vintage-feeling delight that proves that the golden era of full-bodied perfumery isn't nearly as bygone as the doubters might claim. Built around a strikingly animalic blend of rich, dirty florals and even dirtier animalics, Salome is put together with such deft, classic skill that we'd be praising its refinement- that is, if we weren't busy picking our jaws up off the floor. Just as the biblical Salome had a seven-veiled dance of progressive seduction, so too does Salome seduce in tantalizing layers. At first spray, we're struck with bright, bitter orange blossom and the sweet richness of rose and jasmine, with the indolic sensuality of the florals growing gradually. As the rich heart of animalics begins to growl, suggestiveness turns to an all-out bacchanal, with hyraceum, castoreum and an increasingly indolic jasmine all adding their own elements of dirty, carnal power. As Salome reaches the extended final drydown, smoky leather and deep oakmoss begin to move in slower, more deliberate momentum, still every bit as carnal but now even deeper and more luxuriously vintage-feeling. Vibrant, erotic, classic and devastatingly gorgeous, Salome is another big win from one of the most exciting new houses in niche fragrance."," Jasmine, carnation, bitter red orange, Turkish rose, orange blossom, tobacco, hyraceum, styrax, vanilla, hay, patchouli, bergamot, oakmoss, cumin, birch tar, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black I Parfum Extrait,1928,Widian," The original fragrance from Widian by AJ Arabia, Black I distinguishes itself from the flock of Euro/Oriental hybrids in a key way: while inspired by the grandeur of Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi and rich with perfectly blended spices, Black I is not an ode to opulence. Yes, it's gorgeous, compelling, and exotic, but where another brand might have opted for overindulgence and complication, Black I is a streamlined delight: a mouthwatering, captivatingly individual concoction of spice, incense and woods that's as comforting and casually easy to wear as the hippest of modern perfumery could hope to produce. Black I opens with a simple, but extremely compelling, blend of cardamom and cinnamon- spicy but not nose wrinkling, with a savory subtlety that positively enchants. A heart of delicate incense and smooth cypress adds sophistication and depth, while the drydown of musky sandal and cedar contributes longevity and a sexy modern backbone. AJ Arabia's philosophy shuns gender categories and style classifications, opting simply to say, ""Wear What You Like."" We can assure you that we like Black I very much."," Cardamom, cinnamon, incense, cypress, sandalwood, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black II Parfum Extrait,1230,Widian," Perhaps the most unabashedly lush of the Widian by AJ Arabia series, Black II is a sweet, creamy, exotic vanilla dream that will make you weak in the knees. Opening fresh and sweet with a rich, juicy mandarin orange paired with mouthwatering, syrupy plum, Black II carries into an elegant, sensual heart of lush rose paired with velvety sandalwood. A base of indulgently rich, creamy vanilla is the real star of the show, however, lavish enough to flirt with gourmand territory, but brought back into the realm of unisex wearability with sexy flanking notes of musk and oakmoss. It's the kind of fragrance that reminds you that there was a time when vanilla was a preciously held commodity, as valuable as gemstones or silks. A vanilla fragrance like this is still every bit that rare and precious."," Plum, Mandarin, Rose, Sandalwood, Musk, Vanilla, Moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black III Parfum Extrait,1703,Widian," Vital and invigorating, but also deep and soulful, Widian's Black III is this architecturally-minded line's meditation on the most complex and compelling structure of all: human memory. Featuring a gorgeously balanced collection of crisp, energetic top notes and then a deeper, warmer heart and base, Black III emphatically achieves its concept by leaving the wearer enveloped in a state of nostalgic bliss. Black III opens with a springlike burst of fresh citrus and a mouthwatering spearmint that feels more compellingly fruity than bracing or chilled. The effect is striking and emotional, opening you to the warmth of the leather and dry wood heart notes, which have the evocative comfort of a sunbeam through a dusty library window. In the drydown, softly creamy sandalwood and a hint of vanilla further the relaxingly atmospheric sensation, without ever fully relinquishing the spark of the opening notes. The cumulative effect is, as AJ Arabia describes it, rejuvenating. Everyone's happy memories are different, but we're pleased to say that Black III is designed for all of them."," Bergamot, spearmint, leather, dry wood, vanilla, moss, patchouli, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70902.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black IV Parfum Extrait,1419,Widian," Soft, spicy, and deeply sensual, Widian's Black IV upends the normal conventions of spicy florals, using a deep, richly sweet fruit opening and a musky vanilla drydown to create a sexy, surprisingly unisex rose scent that has us captivated. Opening with a burst of juicy bergamot, Black IV quickly sweetens with an intoxicating confection of blackcurrant and prune notes, as deliciously dark as they are sugared. The floral heart of exotic, sensuous rose and white florals retains a carnally indolic element, while a smooth, animalic musk and vanilla drydown only further ups the seductive factor. At the same time, woodsy leather notes balance the femininity and add long lasting power. Make no mistake, Black IV is a floral- and an enticingly sexy one at that."," Bergamot, blackcurrant, prune, rose, white flowers, vanilla, musk, leather, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70903.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Goddess of Love & Perfume Parfum Extrait,2301,4160 Tuesdays," A tribute to Aphrodite, the goddess of pleasure, beauty, love, and- yes- perfume. For this entry in 4160 Tuesdays' Crimes of Passion project, perfumer Sarah McCartney was inspired by the ravishingly full-bodied fruity chypres of the early 1900s, scents like Paul Poiret's Fruits Defendus and Shocking by Schiaparelli. And Goddess of Love & Perfume lives up the the inspiration, delivering a mouthwateringly complex fruit bouquet with an impressively vintage feeling musky drydown. As McCartney describes, this is the scent of power, lust, and attraction, good enough for Venus herself to bathe in ""before descending to earth to seduce beautiful shepherd boys tending their flocks."" Consider us seduced."," Plum, peach, wild strawberry, blackcurrant, raspberry, grapefruit, yuzu, oakmoss, opoponax, bergamot, patchouli, rose, jasmine, lily of the valley, vanilla, vintage musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64618.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Eau Scandaleuse Eau de Parfum,1126,Anatole Lebreton," Because ""leather"" fragrances can span a wide variety of styles and notes, there's room for both creativity and disaster. Luckily, L'Eau Scandaleuse is a triumph: an exuberant, sensual leather shot through with bright fruits, narcotic florals and deeply sexy animalic notes to create one truly intoxicating leather scent. L'Eau Scandaleuse opens juicy and wild, with succulent peach and bergamot and sweet davana. The leather accord here is full-bodied and breathtakingly complex, neither screechy nor overly smoky but nuanced, natural and gently rugged, the lovingly aged leather of treasured heirlooms. Combined with a restrained dose of gorgeous, hypnotic tuberose, the results are achingly lovely. In the drydown, deep animalic notes join the harmony, stimulating the primal sensuality and balancing the florals. Leather scents this masterful are rare achievements for even experienced perfumers. With L'Eau Scandaleuse, Anatole Lebreton is staking his claim to that reputation right out of the gate."," Bergamot, peach, davana, tuberose, ylang ylang, leather, castoreum, cypriol, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bois Lumiere Eau de Parfum,2079,Anatole Lebreton," It is a uniquely French ability to find the romantic sophistication in almost anything, including the inhospitable climate of Mediterranean garrigue land in drought season- climate that inspired the creation of Bois Lumiere. Like a boiling sun beating down on wild immortelle flowers set amongst the parched, rocky terrain, Bois Lumiere projects a dusty, intensely bright floral and woodsy character, honey sweet but bone dry, a hot desert wind that sings of sun-soaked relaxation and an almost alien beauty. Bois Lumiere opens with the aromatics of desert terrain, wild juniper, clary sage and balsam lending resinous richness without a hint of moisture. Through the dryness, sweet honey emerges alongside brittle but sweet florals- immortelle, carnation and rose that lend their perfume to the desert conditions with a dehydrated herbaceousness. In the base, cedarwood provides a stout backdrop for the sweet brightness, absorbing the warmth with languid comfort. Dry, sweet, rich and unique, Bois Lumiere is a dazzling walk across the surface of the sun."," Corsican juniper, clary sage, mandarin, fir balsam, honey, rose, carnation, immortelle, beeswax, atlas cedar, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Maxed Out Parfum Extrait,1134,4160 Tuesdays," Inspired by the crazed youthful misadventures of perfumer Sarah McCartney's friend Maximilian Heusler, Maxed Out is a boozy, swaggering, delicious, illicit journey through the neverending nightlife of New York City. As McCartney puts it, ""The kind of night out in New York you don't remember..."" Don't worry, though- you don't have to have (or admit to) firsthand knowledge of that kind of experience to enjoy Maxed Out, which is as mouthwatering as it is intoxicating, as delightful as it is delirious. The coffee, vanilla and rum, in particular, leap off the skin, taking advantage of the extrait strength to blend into a delectable accord that walks the line between gourmand and narcotic and lasts all the way until the sun is rising over Queens and the bartenders are shouting for last call. Spend a night with Maxed Out. Who knows where you'll end up?"," Rum, coconut and lime, tobacco, coffee, cannabis essential oil, vintage musks, vanilla, cumin, Atlas cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64617.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Alchemico Eau de Parfum,2186,Mazzolari," The Mazzolari line has always embraced duality: a century of history but a newcomer to the niche fragrance scene, classic influences but modern compositions, Italian style and global influence. Alchemico, as the name appropriately suggests, is a fusion of all that Mazzolari was, is, and will be, a suitably dreamlike, yet contemporary, incense scent with classical leanings but thoroughly modern flourishes. Alchemico opens with an instantly compelling top note combining fresh, young rose with smooth cypress and a jolt of energized, crisp pepper, all blended seamlessly with compelling effect. In the heart, the main incense note hits a steady beat almost immediately, playing off the pepper to feel both languidly smokey and energetic all at once, while an earthy geranium note fleshes out the incense's rougher, deeper facets. In the drydown, this is accentuated even more with a spicy, grassy vetiver note, but just when it seems like Alchemico might go too far towards the earth, a soft, warm amber sends it back aloft, adding a lightly sweet undertone that floats the floral woodsiness to the surface yet again. As with any bout of alchemy, choosing the ingredients is only the beginning. It's the blend where the magic gets made."," Rose, cypress, pepper, incense, geranium, vetiver, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32824.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fougere Nobile Eau de Parfum,1827,Nobile 1942," Fresh, vibrant and masculine, the fougere style is meant to stimulate the spirit and empower the wearer. With its bright, effervescent timelessness and rich aromatic soul, Fougere Nobile is a sparkling evocation of ocean breezes and rugged, wild coastline, a classically nostalgic fougere that transcends reductive simplicity with an earthy, richly resinous base. Opening with a crisp sparkle of bergamot, Fougere Nobile instantly invigorates with a complex aromatic blend including basil, lavender, and spicy black pepper. Resinous elemi adds an unexpectedly smoky, cool incense vibe, which is reinforced with light, spicy tobacco and earthy vetiver and patchouli. For any gentleman with an eye towards tradition but both feet firmly planted in the modern, Fougere Nobile is a fragrance of great distinction."," Bergamot, basil absolute, lavender, black pepper, elemi, geranium, aldehydes, tobacco, vetiver, tonka bean, patchouli, sandalwood, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52313.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mortal Skin Eau de Parfum,2823,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," Inspired by the deadly grace of the viper so exquisitely represented on the bottle, Mortal Skin is a meditation on danger, passion and hypnotic obsession that straddles eastern and western perfumery as only Stephane Humbert Lucas can do. Mortal Skin opens with tantalizing mystery, as a cooling, otherworldly ink accord meets sweet, sticky blackberry and resinous rockrose, at once captivating and threatening, familiar and alien. In the heart, the snake rears back to strike, warm opoponax and myrrh washing over us along aromatic and sweet florals and wisps of spice, hypnotizing in their sway. And once we've realized the power contained within, the resinous base of labdanum, styrax and birch, it's far too late to escape- Mortal Skin has us completely in its grip. Beguiling and seductive, this is a fragrance not to be missed."," Blackberry, Ink, Rockrose, Opoponax, Iris, Davana, Myrrh, Cardamom, Ambergris, Storax, Sandalwood, Labdanum, Civet, Atlas Cedarwood, Birch, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65511.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Spirituelle Eau de Cologne,2930,Divine," Gorgeously musky, lusciously floral, timelessly elegant. Spirituelle is modern and classic at once, a soft, full-bodied bouquet of roses with an invigorating peppery opening and a sexy, warm drydown that makes us weak in the knees. Spirituelle showcases the type of versatility we've grown to love from Divine- sophisticated and composed enough to wear with a ballgown, gorgeous and fresh enough to turn heads in a t-shirt and jeans. You've smelled rose and musk together before, but you've never smelled it like this."," Pink pepper, sichaun pepper, geranium, labdanum, rose, cedar, amber, musk, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22715.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Amber perfume oil,2372,Michele Bergman," A luminous veil of exceptionally creamy amber. Warm and embracing – this enchanting oil is for those who are enamored of amber's sweet side, rather than its mysterious or powdery aspects.  A touch of vanilla and amber melt into each other like long lost lovers – and far be it from us to ever separate them again when they are so obviously made for each other. Luscious and inviting, wearing this fragrance makes us feel like we have a cozy, golden aura around us, protecting us from anything that would make us cold or cranky. If we could, we  would purr."," Tunisian amber, vanilla, hint of patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
She Came to Stay Eau de Parfum,2968,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes," Inspired by the Simone de Beauvoir existentialist novel, Timothy Han's debut fragrance is a disarmingly complex all-natural chypre with a uniquely balanced spicy herbal character that evolves differently with each application. Like the novel's characters, who find their relationships and sense of self forced into great transition by the events of the world around them, this captivating scent seems nearly impossible to pin down, echoing the passion and creative energy that lifts itself above the austerity and oppression of a Paris on the verge of cataclysmic change.She Came To Stay opens with fresh, sexy aromatic top notes of geranium, lemon and basil giving way to a richly spiced heart featuring Indonesian clove and nutmeg. In a stunning and perpetually changing drydown, deep woody notes of labdanum, patchouli and oakmoss ebb and flow with a more ephemeral forest of cedarwood and vetiver, again supplemented by the crisp lemon and basil of the opening. Both classic and modern, fresh and warm, aromatic and earthy, inspiring us, in that grandly existential tradition, to relinquish our illusions of control and simply allow the power of the fragrance to go where it may.Each package will feature one of five limited edition prints created by award winning visual artist Kirtland Ash."," Geranium, basil, lemon, Indonesian clove, nutmeg, patchouli, vetiver, labdanum, oakmoss, cedarwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'homme de Coeur Eau de Parfum,2490,Divine," A bracing and peppery opening of juniper, angelica and cypress clears the way for the noble and soulful iris which is very much the heart of this elegant, masculine scent. Vetiver, amber and wild vanilla bring a deep, dusky woodiness that rounds out the fragrance without ever making it heavy. Fresh and subtle, but with a commanding presence. Perfect for the strong, silent type."," angelica, juniper berries, cypress, iris, vetiver, ambergris, wild vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22712.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Homme Sage Eau de Parfum,1727,Divine," An incredible blend of spice, fruit, wood and incense that leaves us weak in the knees. The sage in the name refers not to the herb, but to wisdom. However, if we met anyone, man or woman, who smelled this good, their IQ would be the last thing on our minds.   A spicy opening of saffron, lychee, mandarin and cardamom entices us down a mysterious path where we discover woods amber, patchouli, immortelle and incense, all layering so beautifully that we can't tell where one ends and another begins. All we can do is revel in the enveloping, woodsy, earthy warmth. Serene and hypnotic, this is a scent that seduces quietly, but oh-so effectively."," saffron, mandarin, cardamom, lychee, aromatic woods, immortelle (or everlasting flower), patchouli, oak moss, amber, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22713.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Etre Aime - Homme Eau de Parfum,1931,Divine," Yvon Mouchel, dedicated the 7th addition to the world of Divine to a perfume we will never forget, the fragrance of the one we love.  Linked to its feminine counterpart by the same name, l'Ãªtre aimÃ© homme (The Beloved Man) also shares with it the main note, the everlasting flower. Focusing on the aromatic aspect of the plant, l'Ãªtre aimÃ© homme is a woody, boldly spiced scent the masculinity of which is not aggressive but unmistakable. The lively blend of lavender and bergamot gets an extra zing from ginger and a hint of greenness from basil. The piquant accord in the heart of the fragrance mixes helicrysium with cardamom. Amber, exotic woods, patchouli and vetiver provide a rich, dark background for the composition and lend the base a luxurious, classic feel. Masculine perfumery at its finest!"," bergamot, lavender, ginger, basil, cardamom, everlasting flower, cistus, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22714.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Augusto Eau de Parfum,2592,Mazzolari," The legacy of the Mazzolari line dates back to the original Augusto Mazzolari, a late-1800's Milan barber renowned for the fresh, bright fragrances he would whip up on the spot for his customers. It continued through his grandson, also named Augusto, who took the family fragrance business and expanded it beyond the barbershop and out to the world. Now, Mazzolari honors both family and history with Augusto, a fresh, invigoratingly elegant scent appropriate for a gentleman of any era. Augusto opens with a tart, sparkling dose of bergamot and orange, made cool and refreshing with a spike of mint. A heart of rosewood maintains a sense of clean refinement, with geranium and lavender adding a smooth, masculine complexity. In the dry down, the depth and refinement of ambergris and sandalwood reinforce a sense of classic, understated sophistication. Equally perfect in any situation from the barbershop to the boardroom to the ballroom, Augusto is a testament to the storied history of one of our favorite houses."," Bergamot, sweet orange, mint, rosewood, geranium, lavender, vetiver, amber, sandalwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32820.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Le Rose Eau de Parfum,2437,Mazzolari," Like the perfect cocktail, the perfect dress, or the perfect sunset, a perfect rose perfume need not be loud, or flashy, or bogged down by excess detail. Instead, it needs only to be pure, delicate, and true to the subtleties of the queen of all flowers. Le Rose is all of these things, a breathtakingly elegant, beautifully understated rose par excellence meant for the woman who never chases trends but instead is in complete control of her own personal style. Le Rose, as you might imagine, opens with a sole focus on rose, and this one is lusciously delicate: fresh, lightly green, natural, and rich without ever seeming overpowering. Indian sandalwood enhances the rose's woodsier and creamier aspects, while a base of sheer white musk projects a lighter-than-air sexiness that lingers for hours. Le Rose is too straightforward to have a whole bunch of tricks up its sleeve- but this beautifully simple floral proves that one perfect trick is often all you need."," Rose, Indian sandalwood, musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32821.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pichola Eau de Parfum,2046,Neela Vermeire Creations," Lake Pichola is the crown jewel and central focus of the princely city of Udaipur. A myriad of colourful historic, architectural and spiritual reflections reflect from the surface of this ancient yet manmade treasure - the sunlight and moonlight of each season bringing out the eternal and timeless beauty of the lake and the Rajasthan regionPichola, the latest fragrance from Neela Vermeire Creations, captures this beauty and era-spanning elegance in a symphony of fresh, vibrant orange blossom, tender tuberose, sweet ylang, and tart, crisp mandarin. A princely spice blend- redolent saffron, dry cinnamon, cardamom- dance atop the citrus and flower, while a resinous woody base, sandalwood and vetiver, add a touch of deeper contrast without ever weighing down the exuberance of this magical concoction.Like the reflections over the lake surface, constantly shifting but always reflecting the same colorful, diverse and impossibly rich city next to which it rests, Pichola is a fragrance of luxurious depth, gorgeous light, and immense character. Another triumph from Neela Vermeire."," Cardamom, cinnamon, saffron, juniper, magnolia, neroli oil, clementine, bergamot, orange blossom absolute, rose absolute, tuberose absolute, jasmine sambac, ylang-ylang, benzoin absolute, sandalwood, driftwood, vetiver from Haiti.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56506.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
O/E Eau de Parfum,1433,Bogue Profumo," Like any great architect, Antonio Gardoni is obsessed with structure and balance, and the concept that any fragrance, no matter how big and complex, can stand on the head of a pin if the engineering is sound. So it should come as no surprise that O/E, Bogue Profumo's followup to last year's sensational Maai and Cologne Reloaded, is, like its predecessors, a paradox- an elaborately structured, hugely complicated edifice of bright, shining citruses, naturally green spices and florals, warm natural wood notes and sheer synthetic ones, and an underpinning of smoky animalic notes- all of which somehow lock together to form something bright, surprisingly light, and cheerfully uncategorizable.  The combinations are exquisite- an ultra-fresh bergamot opening stands atop a spicy, fresh herb garden of rosemary and thyme. Balsamic camphor cools off a bough of juniper, pine and cypress. A lilt of lush florals offset a benzoin-tinged resinousness, and a transluscent layer of iso-E super wraps it all together and marks the composition as unmistakably 21st century. Each bold stroke is effortlessly complimented with the kind of artistic and architectural virtuosity that balances, but never overlaps, leaving the finished product as impressive in its scope as it is wonderfully enjoyable. Halfway between acoustic and electric, digital and analogue, artisanal and industrial, indoors and outdoors, O/E is another triumph from a truly contemporary talent."," Bergamot, grapefruit, lemon, neroli, clove, black pepper, rosemary, thyme, camphor, Lebanon cedar, juniper, pine, cypress, rose, jasmine, vetiver, benzoin, tobacco, resins, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66903.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Asphalt Rainbow Scratch & Sniff Sticker Set,1102,Charenton Macerations," Limited Edition Asphalt Rainbow Scratch & Sniff Stickers.Asphalt Rainbow draws inspiration from the ""break the rules"" attitude of global street art: a creative world movement that teaches anything can be a canvas and anyone an artist. Specifically exploring the concepts of distortion, reappropriation, and impermanence, Asphalt Rainbow borrows from a series of masterful street art techniques to craft an olfactive love letter to the street: a roughed up rose that's been hyper-colored, torn apart and twisted on its head, then nailed to the wall for your sniffing pleasure. The arc of the fragrance mirrors the unpredictable lifecycle of street art: a re-envisioned rose accord that distorts and morphs over time like a fragmented floral collage stretched across urban walls and alleyways; its aerosol-tinged aroma ever-fading closer to background."," Rose Absolute, Rose Fragments, Spray Paint (Aerosols), Galbanum, Lily of the Valley, Lychee, Ylang, Saffron, Magnolia, Leather, Cistus, Asphalt, Detritus, Patchouli, Wood, Amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Asphalt Rainbow Eau de Parfum,1809,Charenton Macerations," Asphalt Rainbow, a tribute to the creativity, spontaneity and political bravery of modern urban street art, succeeds in much the same way that its predecessor Christopher Street did: it's a high-concept, passionate, literate fragrance that, at the end of the day, smells both unique and just plain good. Drawing on the concepts of distortion, reappropriation and impermanence that inform street artists from Blek le Rat to Retna, Asphalt Rainbow takes a universally known perfume note- the rose- and puts it through an impressive bag of artists' tricks, presenting a rose that seems both unnaturally vivid but also surprisingly well-structured, as if stenciled with day-glo spraypaint. A distinct aerosol note lingers above it, and quickly a whole modern cityscape follows- damp pavement, auto exhaust, street food, brick walls, and the fleeting scents of a million strangers brushing past one another in a hurry to anywhere but where they are at this exact moment. That rose brings us back for sniff after sniff, daring us to separate it from the city on whose back it lives, until we realize that we can't- that the city and the flower are one and the same, faded into one another. Fresh, captivating, distinctly modern and urban, Asphalt Rainbow is not only a worthy follow-up to Christopher Street, but also confirmation that Charenton Macerations is a house of true skill and vision."," Rose Absolute, Rose Fragments, Galbanum, Lily of the Valley, Lychee, Ylang, Saffron, Magnolia, Leather, Cistus, Asphalt, Patchouli, Wood, Amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cristallo di Rocca Eau de Parfum,1587,Omnia Profumo," Rock crystal (also known as quartz) has long captured human imagination not in spite of its unadulterated beauty, but because of it: as one of the earliest forms of jewelry, its striking clarity and natural facets made it a prized accessory long before modern gemstone cutting and polishing methods came into vogue. Cristallo di Rocca pays tribute to this treasured material in full, with a clear, beautifully balanced scent that weaves fresh, clean floral beauty in with a striking mineralic spice blend for an olfactory experience that truly mirrors the intended subject. Like noticing a strikingly clear stone for the first time, Cristallo di Roca opens fresh, bright and clean, with a crisp citrus and delicate floral blend. The gently spicy heart, made up of clove, iris and intriguingly sweet notes of rum and almond, feel wonderfully tactile, as if the edges of the crystal haven't yet been polished into complete conformity, but sparkle nonetheless. A soft base of sandalwood and creamy vanilla is like the exquisite but understated setting, providing sophisticated contrast. Like your fragrance, your jewelry of choice makes a statement about your character. Cristallo di Rocca identifies the wearer, on both counts, as someone for whom individuality coexists perfectly with elegance."," Almond, citrus, lily of the valley, rose, geranium, ylang ylang, cloves, rum, iris, sandalwood, vanilla, and rock crystal.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46109.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Morning Muscs Eau de Parfum,1195,Alexandre. J," There's more than one path to irresistible, and Morning Muscs, with its light, energetic blend of juicy fruit notes married to premium rose and violet, achieves its sexiness precisely because it's just so comfortable in its own skin. Perfect for every woman confident enough in her sexiness to be as ""girly"" as she wants to be, Morning Muscs is an addictive, can't-stop-sniffing-it delight. Opening with rich, juicy peach and sweet toffee that leads into a sumptuous mix of Russian and Turkish roses and sweet violet, Morning Muscs whisks us through a sunrise of delights before ultimately seducing with a mossy, musky drydown. Because anyone who says fun and sexy don't go together really isn't someone we want to have anything to do with, anyway."," Mandarin orange, grapefruit, peach, iris, damask rose, violet, patchouli, musk and moss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Muscs Eau de Parfum,1787,Alexandre. J," While plenty of fragrances use ""Black"" in the title to convey intense woods, or fierce, challenging animalics, Black Muscs, with its subtly sensational blend of citrus, lightly floral muskiness, and resonant amber, is far more aligned to the elegant universality of the color- more like a finely tailored tuxedo than a horror movie monster. Opening with a fresh bergamot and lemon blend, transitioning with a lovely rose and patchouli heart, and ultimately settling into a deep, confident amber-and-musk drydown pitched at just the right volume, Black Muscs is a perfect scent for anyone that carries themselves with dignity, but never lets it lapse into self-seriousness. Luxury needn't be pompous, but as Black Muscs proves, it should always be luxurious."," Bergamot, lemon, violet, rose, patchouli, amber, and musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose Oud Eau de Parfum,1900,Alexandre. J," One of perfumery's most classic combinations is made new again with this sparkling, spicy oriental stunner. Opening with a burst of deliciously candied fruits, Rose Oud quickly transitions into full seduction mode with a deep, luscious rose note set against a rich, musky oud and white woods accord accompanied with rare saffron and a sweet note of patchouli. A base of deep vanilla and ambery musks maintains a sensual complexity for untold hours. Deep, complex and utterly swoon-worthy."," Rose, agarwood, musk, amber, lemon, olibanum and sandalwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Silver Ombre Eau de Parfum,2027,Alexandre. J," The seductive mystery of the orient in a ravishing fragrance for women and men alike. Silver Ombre does indeed feature amber, a lusciously warm and delectable amber, in fact, but to get there, one must first wander through a beautifully appointed marketplace teeming with exotic treasures. Fresh fruits, apple, raspberry and crisp citrus, excite and energize, followed by cart after cart of immaculate flowers, rose and iris, plucked at the exact height of their fragrant powers. Savory saffron and rich vanilla waft in from the spice stands, and exotic woods and patchouli lend power. Finally, we make our way to the amber, and it's all we hoped for, rich, lightly powdery, sweet and deep. Amber lovers of all persuasions- don't miss this one."," Raspberry, lemon, apple, rose, iris, saffron, musk, patchouli, amber, vanilla and white woods.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vaniglia Eau de Parfum,1463,Mazzolari," Mazzolari's Vaniglia presents all the charm and the enveloping warmth of a cozy vanilla scent.  Creamy caramel and the seductive fragrance of delicate exotic orchids produce a decadent marshmallow quality - the best marshmallow you've ever tasted. The exquisite floral notes of orchid are subtle, but they beautifully enhance the femininity of the fragrance, taking it to a softer, more refined place. Not too sugary or sweet, just a perfect taste of sweetness from Mazzolari."," Vanilla, caramel, orchid",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32816.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Christopher Street Eau de Parfum,1567,Charenton Macerations," Home to merchants and misfits, Beatniks and Bohemians, dissidents and protesters, New York City's Christopher Street has established a reputation for celebrating rugged and rebellious individualism. Like the unique architecture of the street's triangular-shaped Northern Dispensary, Christopher Street introduces a distinctive fragrance structure that challenges traditional olfactive notions of gender. Unlike unisex fragrances that target a lowest common denominator (i.e. choosing the least offensive, neutered ingredients for formulation), Christopher Street revels in the unexpected harmonies of its strong masculine and feminine notes. The fragrance combines classical floral chypre elements with more subversive tones of metals, smoky tobacco, watered down alcohol, wet woods and clove."," Alcoholic lime, bergamot, bitter orange, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, clove bud, orange blossom, poet carnation, incense, moss, musk, myrrh, patchouli.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rudis Eau de Parfum,1132,Nobile 1942," In ancient Rome, the“rudis” was the wooden practice sword of a gladiator, worn into the arena as a symbol of his strength and valor. With Rudis, Nobile 1942 brings us a full portrait of one such ancient warrior, garbed in hardened leather armor, his sword adorned with flowers for courage and luck, fortified with wine and spirits for the battle that awaits. Rudis opens with an opulent blend of whiskey and leather, infused with tart fruits, smoky wood, buttery saffron, and the golden sweetness of immortelle. The leather feels as supple as expensive calfskin, but its luxuriousness has a sensual side from the musk and ambered warmth. A streak of red wine runs through the base, alongside roses redolent with patchouli and spice, balancing the raw masculinity of the opening notes and making Rudis feel both unisex and surprisingly modern. Sweet and spicy, golden and creamy, smoky and earthy, Rudis is an utterly intoxicating stitch in time connecting Europe's past, present, and future in an undeniably captivating fragrance."," bergamot, dried fruits, rose, geranium, clove, saffron, cedar wood, leathery notes, patchouli, vetiver, immortelle, musk and incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52312.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gardenia Eau de Parfum,2869,M. Micallef," GARDENIA is part of the Exclusif collection which bottles are hand-decorated with Swarovski crystals. Opening on peach and gardenia, this perfume reveals a festival of gardenia discretely supported by ylang-ylang and jasmine and finely warmed with sandalwood, amber and musk. A delicious fragrance for romantic ladies."," Gardenia, peach, ylang-ylang, jasmine, sandalwood, ambergris, white musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24547.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mohur Extrait Parfum Extrait,2677,Neela Vermeire Creations," Mohur Extrait is based on the Mohur EDP fragrance but has a much higher concentration of perfume.  The perfume has been left to macerate far longer to transfer even more of the absolute to fragrance and allow the full range of notes to blossom. The complexity of the fragrance has increased considerably, intertwining wood, leather, spices, Oudh and the blooming rose in an intoxicating blend offering the ultimate olfactory experience to the perfume wearer.  To be used in moderation, like all finer things in life.Mohur Extrait is a numbered, limited-edition, one time offering."," Cardamom, coriander, ambrette, carrot seeds, pepper, elemi, iris, jasmine, rose, violet, almond, leather, sandalwood, amber, woody notes, patchouli, agarwood (oud), benzoin, vanilla, and tonka bean.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Maai Eau de Parfum,1232,Bogue Profumo," Maai is a stunning accomplishment in modern perfumery as it marries the very best of old-school chypre glamour and bold animalics with a refined elegance and smoothness. It opens with a burst of incredibly mossy greenness, fused with roses, jasmine, and green tuberose, all sprinkled with a transparent veil of golden, glittering aldehydes. The plush bouquet is mesmerizing in its depth, and harkens back to a time before IFRA/EU regulations, but it's truly heart-stopping when combined with the animalic elements. Musky, leathered, and skanky, they cast a mighty roar that transforms the delicate swirl of feminine florals into something more unisex with a masculine touch that will appeal to fans of the legendary Kouros or Muscs Koublai Khan. As Maai unfolds, balsamic resins awaken in the base to add subtle streaks of smokiness and honeyed sweetness. At the same time, the amber slowly turns the whole fragrance deeper, richer, and softer, coating the musky leather in its warmth and taming its skanky cry. In its drydown, Maai transforms into golden velvet with a smooth, plush mix of amber, musk, and oakmoss.We found Maai to be one of the boldest, most sophisticated chypres we've encountered in a while. A symphonic masterpiece in the vein of Jubilation 25 and Kouros, it is not a fragrance for the faint of heart but for those who have mourned the loss of vintage glamour with an animalic edge. Black-tie galas seem like a perfect occasion for this incredibly opulent, concentrated scent, but so are moments when you want to seduce with naked sensuality. Maai's unconventional heart beats with such wildness and passion, it feel almost alive. Yet, at the end of the day, everything pales before that luxurious oakmoss which is piled on in such lavish layers that it took our breath away. Maai is the epitome of sophistication in the grandest tradition of haute perfumery, and we're sure its timeless beauty will impress even the most jaded connoisseur."," tuberose, rose, jasmine, ylang ylang, civet, castoreum, hyraceum, dried fruits, sandalwood, oakmoss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
SHE Shihan Eau de Parfum,1961,Piotr Czarnecki," If Piotr Czarnecki's instant cult hit Shihan (formerly called Sensei) was an ode to the perfumer's roots as a professional ballroom dancer- sensual, balanced, and unexpectedly muscular- then SHE Shihan could rightfully be thought of as an even more elegant, unabashedly feminine ballet. Building from the original's unisex oriental gourmand notes of tobacco, whiskey, vanilla and spices, SHE Shihan glides confidently into the world of women's scent, adding a sweet, fresh garden rose to the still beguilingly spiced opening. In the heart of the fragrance, the original's myrrh and frankincense are rounded out with an exquisite, slightly chocolately plum and floral notes of violet and rose petal. While the drydown still features a sweet, shimmering labdanum and ambrette base, the addition of extra vanilla keeps SHE Shihan carefully walking the line between classically rich and surprisingly sexy.No matter what aspect of this gracefully sweet, gorgeously captivating fragrance appeals the most, we're positive that Piotr Czarnecki has yet again stolen our hearts."," Plum, violet, rose, tobacco, incense, spices, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mood Indigo Eau de Parfum,1234,Moth and Rabbit," For Mood Indigo, perfumer Mark Buxton was inspired by Michel Gondry's film, ""L'ecume des Jours"" (Mood Indigo):""For me the film L'Ã‰CUME DES JOURS as a whole was carried by Jazz music; I like this ambiance. The flowers play a strong role (water lily) the film which starts gay and luminous turns and becomes very dark! The fragrance is based on dark woody notes with a lot of incense, which represents the Jazz music for me. There is a short passage in the fragrance, where you smell the light, bright water lily. The chamomile and red pepper give rhythm and movement to the whole accord."" ”” Mark Buxton"," Red pepper, camomile romaine, geranium, waterlily, musk, sandalwood, incense, amber, cedarwood, and patchouli.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The scent is then incorporated into the viewer experience during the film screening.  For Love Exposure, perfumer Mark Buxton was inspired by Sion Sono's film by the same name:""I was inspired by the films mixture of love, lust, violence, sex and religion. A story told with a certain kind of humor and tension that builds up and leads you to an unforeseeable ending. ”” love. A delicate floral scent, somehow innocent, but heady and strong at the same time. ”” lust. Clean, but kinky animal notes which run through the scent like a red thread; costus, indol and cumin and ambergris. ”” violence. The surprising bloody note from the bucchu oil, bay and metallic notes. ”” sex. A smell of hot wet skin communicated through a mixture of musk, vanilla and sandalwood. And ”” religion. Translated through my all time favorite incense with light sharp woody notes and a touch of amber. ” - Mark Buxton"," Ylang, magnolia flowers, neroli oil, cassis, bay oil, cumin oil, costus, jasmine sambac, encens, musk, sandalwood, ambergris, and vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Anubis Eau de Parfum,1152,Papillon Artisan Perfumes," With a name inspired by the Egyptian God of the afterlife, Anubis embodies the sacred mysteries of Ancient Egypt. Heady blooms of jasmine, amid rich suede, smoulder over an incense laden base of frankincense, sandalwood, and labdanum.Vivid slashes of immortelle, pink lotus and saffron create a perfume shrouded in darkness and veiled in mystery. Discover Anubis, if you dare.""Anubis began life as a signature scent for myself. I have always been drawn to dark, leathery scents and the metamorphosis of Anubis from personal sketch to final product has been considerable. It was nameless until it was completed and it was then that I realised my obsession with ancient Egypt had subconsciously manifested itself; the initial materials used, synonymous with mummification, have now been sweetened into a dark but delicious fragrance. After many reincarnations, Anubis was born."" - Liz Moores, perfumer"," Suede, jasmine, pink lotus, immortelle, olibanum, myrrh and saffron.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tobacco Rose Eau de Parfum,1501,Papillon Artisan Perfumes," A sensual blend of Bulgarian rose, geranium and Rose de Mai form an opulent backdrop of velvety rose notes set against a luxuriously rich and smoky base of French hay and earthy oak moss.Soft animalic touches of ambergris and beeswax have been suspended in a sumptuous blend of musks, creating an enigmatic, alluring and unmistakable perfume. A stunningly different interpretation of the majestic rose.""Anthropomorphised throughout literature and poetry the illustrious rose is immortally bound to its sweet, old fashioned and pretty stereotype. Tobacco Rose combines the scent of overblown roses with rich, mineral notes, as though one were breathing in not only the fading petals but the rich earth from which a rose grows. This is a perfume that rejects prettiness but instead combines the opposing masculine and feminine elements that fuse within nature."" - Liz Moores, perfumer"," Bulgarian rose, rose de mai, oakmoss, ambergris, beeswax and peru balsam.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66501.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Angelique Eau de Parfum,1254,Papillon Artisan Perfumes," Inspired by the astonishing beauty of the Iris Pallida flower, Angelique captures the delicate essence of a delightful Spring garden. Cascades of French mimosa, osmanthus and white champac are woven between the powdered, violet facets of precious orris. Virginian cedarwood and subtle notes of frankincense bring an ethereal light and delicate freshness to this tender composition.""Inspiration for my perfumes comes to me in many ways, but none more so than from the nature in my own garden. Angelique began as an olfactory portrait of the Iris Pallida; days spent breathing in the delicate scent of the flowers and the honeyed aroma of pollen emerged as nature's own sketch of what Angelique would become. Angelique became a perfume based on my personal impression of the beautiful Iris Pallida, a flower that is as captivating and angelic as nature herself.""- Liz Moores, perfumer"," Mimosa petals, orris, champaca, osmanthus, cedar and olibanum.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
2022 Generation Homme Eau de Parfum,2235,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," 2022 represents an important year for the future of the Middle East: as Qatar will play host to the World Cup, the eyes of the world will be upon a great gathering in the heart of the region, an event that, at best, has the potential to demonstrate true sharing among more developed nations and states that are still struggling. Against this backdrop, Stephane Humbert Lucas presents 2022 Generation Man, a fragrance that employs a unique blend of timeless opulence and sleek modernity to represent the distinct character of today's sophisticated Middle Eastern man.2022 Generation Man opens with an unexpectedly bright burst of juicy blackcurrant and zesty yuzu, kept cool with a spritz of fresh mint. It's a wonderful twist for those expecting a by-the-numbers oud and spices, establishing a portrait of a modern young Middle Easterner prepared to greet the global community with as much style and warmth as imposing sophistication. The oud, of course, is present; a fabulously rich heart made from prized Cambodian agarwood of such rare distinction that it can hardly be compared to the synthetically sharp or pungently sour ouds of lesser brands. This is an oud that asserts its own value, dry and distinguished, powerful and almost translucent, connecting the fragrance to an unbroken line of tradition without ever dragging the composition backwards. As a base of rich spices and warm balsamic musk swell in support, the timeless luxury of Middle Eastern perfumery blends seamlessly with modern creativity for a sexy, sophisticated scent any man could wear with confidence.  Presented in a beautiful black lacquered bottle with a handcrafted gold cap, 2022 Generation Man is more than just a striking fragrance; it's a masterful statement."," Yuzu zest, blackcurrant, mint, Cambodian oud, precious oud, spices, balsamic notes.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65510.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Shihan Eau de Parfum,1196,Piotr Czarnecki," A personal labor of love, Shihan is Piotr Czarnecki's tribute to the natural connection between fragrance and dance. As a professional ballroom dancer and dance instructor in his native Poland, Czarnecki had long employed a lifetime obsession with scentmaking to compose fragrances meant to accompany his routines and those of his students, to, in his words,“create their own atmosphere.” But while it may have been originally created for a select few students, Shihan, a warm, exquisitely balanced oriental gourmand, is simply too good to keep secret.  As with a finely crafted dance program, his fragrance (formerly called Sensei) weaves around its central composition with graceful fluidity, revealing wondrous new aspects with each passing moment. The foundation of exceptionally high quality, largely natural ingredients: in the opening, Cuban tobacco and bitter Arabic coffee lend earthy depth to a boozy warm whiskey accord, while colonial spices enliven a mysterious heart of frankincense and myrrh, evoking visions of grand, exotic opulence. A musky amber base purrs with carefully extracted labdanum and sweet ambrette, dreamily resinous.A perfect blend of lively spice and warm richness that will delight fans of gourmands and orientals alike."," Whiskey, coffee, tobacco, pepper, cinnamon, incense, myrrh, spicy accord, ambrette, labdanum, benzoin, amber and musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Gemstone Eau de Parfum,2259,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," A fragrance named for the sacred cornerstone of the very center of the Grand Mosque of Mecca demands a refinement and respect for both subject and composition. But StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas is no mere tourist, and Black Gemstone, through its captivatingly complex blend of myrrh, lemon and smoky incense, indeed inspires a profound respect bordering on wonderment. The Black Stone of Mecca is purported to have fallen directly from Heaven, and the ingredients of Black Gemstone are clearly intended to come as close to otherworldly as possible. Pristinely tart Italian lemon, rich Olibanum-derived incense and three hand-selected types of cedar are but a few of the treasured components, but the true centerpiece is an extraordinary myrrh, painstakingly distilled down into a resinous tar that, like the Black Stone itself, projects a presence that far exceeds its size. And like a true religious experience, Black Gemstone follows no linear path- from moment to the moment, the tartness of the lemon, smokiness of the incense and balsamic sweetness of the myrrh dance around one another with an unpredictability that promises to make each individual encounter profoundly unique.Presented in an elegantly understated black lacquered bottle, with a unique hand-milled black honeycomb top and a small faceted black Swarovski crystal."," Infusion of three cedars lemon, myrrh, tar, incense, teak, tonka.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oumma Eau de Parfum,1663,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas describes Oumma as a study of the contrasts of agarwood (oud), a substance he views with mystical reverence. A single sniff of Oumma can more than explain why: based around the finest Burmese oud and buttressed by Moroccan Rose, Egyptian jasmine and Peruvian Balsam, this fragrance is drawn from the rarest sources on the planet and yet, it hardly feels earthly at all. Instead, Oumma seems to rise from the ground, stretching out each extraordinary facet of its central ingredient until the smoky, spicy wood and subtly sharp, medicinal aphrodisiac properties that make up the duality of oud seem to exist simultaneously, suspended in mid-air. Simply put, Oumma is a fragrance that makes you look to the heavens.A dry, spicy rose and elegantly savory saffron hover beneath, but this is nothing like the lavish-yet-rote oud-rose pairings widely available elsewhere. Rather, these exceptional ingredients, each deserving of a starring role in a different composition, combine with smoke-saturated cade ash to build the earthly pyre from which this singularly extraordinary oud might ascend even higher.Even the bottle itself seems prepared to leave the ground: shiny and silver, as bright and reflective as the mid-day sky, finished with a polished silver cap and a Swarovski“diamond” placed on the crown. We've never experienced an oud quite like this."," Egyptian jasmine, Moroccan rose, Peruvian balsam, balsam tolu, ashes of cade, Burmese oud, nagarmotha.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose de Petra Eau de Parfum,1507,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," Petra: capital of the Nabataeans, a wonder of ancient engineering, an ornately beautiful kingdom carved entirely into the side of the mountain thought to be the biblical Sinai itself. Words cannot hope to describe the majesty of the place known as the Rose City, but StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas chose a far more appropriate medium with Rose de Petra, a breathtaking floral that honors both halves of its namesake with a rose equal parts refreshingly natural and sumptuously mysterious. We like to think of Rose de Petra as a journey down an ancient stone canyon, with wild roses in full bloom springing from every crack in the rock. What begins as a simple, beautiful journey opens itself to mystery and wonder- that clean, bright rose we smell is no single, simple note but rather an intense rose oxide given body and mouthwatering juiciness from pomegranate and litchi. As the heart of pure, natural Bulgarian rose expands, so too do the spices- cardamom, cumin and pepper, intense enough to invigorate but light enough to place this scent a world away from a typical rose chypre. Here, yet again, we see the necessity of Lucas' uncompromising commitment to top quality ingredients, as Rose de Petra's deceptively simple formula belies an astounding integrity we would not have thought possible from reading the notes alone. Like a fully irrigated city carved into a mountain in the middle of the desert, Rose de Petra is a masterpiece of construction that will knock you over with its beauty.Presented in a genuine gold-lettered transparent bottle, adorned with a unique hand-milled gold honeycomb top and a small faceted peach-colored Swarovski crystal placed on the crown."," Rose oxide, pomegranate, litchi, Bulgarian rose, pepper, cardamom, cumin seeds.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Soleil de Jeddah Eau de Parfum,2234,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," Few places on the planet have a closer relationship to the sun than the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah, the Bride of the Red Sea, gateway to Mecca and Medina. To honor a great city that is both religious epicenter and vacation destination, cultural capital and center of commerce, StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas chose to focus the one element equally present and central to all endeavors, and contained within the brilliant gold-metallic bottle is a sun-drenched, rapturously bright citrus-floral that gradually evolves to reveal hidden depths of Russian leather, Madagascar vanilla, buttery iris, and earthy amber. Like the multi-faceted city of Jeddah itself, the reasons for going and the reasons for staying may be entirely different. The initial brightness of Soleil de Jeddah is a thing of unapologetic beauty: tart, juicy lemon, pillow-soft Roman chamomile, and an exquisite osmanthus so mouthwateringly jammy that we've variously detected peach, apricot, lychee, and mango, albeit without any of the cloying sweetness that might accompany any of those notes in a lesser fragrance. In fact, for a fragrance this big and bright, it's a minor miracle that Soleil de Jeddah never deviates into reductive sweetness or overdone sour, which we can only attribute to the exceptional quality of the ingredients, as well as a lightly powdery iris root heart that seamlessly bridges the gap into the earthier, surprisingly sensual base. Once the Russian leather emerges, rich and resinous with a very slight smokiness, what might have seemed like a strange and unfamiliar progression is now natural, intriguing, and deeply satisfying. Like the beautiful, hand-milled golden honeycombed cap, the Jeddah sun shines brightly enough to bring everything together, with undeniably beautiful results."," Lemon, Roman chamomile, osmanthus, iris root, amber, earthy notes, iris butter, Russian leather, vanilla from Madagascar.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65504.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Khol de Bahrein Eau de Parfum,2671,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," KhÃ´l: one of the world's earliest cosmetics and the essence of ancient beauty. Think Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra, immaculate jet-black lines of khÃ´l framing piercing violet eyes, infusing what was already stunning with near-mystical seductive power. KhÃ´l de Bahrein is a tribute to the elegance and ingenuity of the ancient world, where the untold balsamic depths of a sumptuous amber-benzene heart frame a strikingly lovely violet and iris led floral with masterful precision. KhÃ´l de Bahrein opens with complimentary waves of deep, resinous amber and an iris both richly earthy and subtly sweet. As the iris evolves to an almost candied sweetness, the violet and ambergris weave seamlessly in, lending a powdery softness that anchors without ever diluting. It is an exquisite balancing act achievable only with the finest natural iris and ambergris, highest-quality ingredients that also result in a projection and longevity impossible with mundane synthetics.Presented in a genuine gold-lettered transparent bottle, adorned with a unique hand-milled gold honeycomb top and a small faceted peach-colored Swarovski crystal, KhÃ´l de Bahrein is that rarest of treasures: a celebration of timeless beauty that proves itself equally beautiful, inside and out."," Violet, nougat, gums, iris powder, sandalwood, benzoin, amber, musky balsamic notes.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
O Hira Eau de Parfum,2748,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," To say that O Hira is perhaps the finest amber fragrance in the world isn't so much a matter of opinion as it is a matter of pedigree. 777 creator and nose StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas became fixated on creating an amber scent that would spare no expense, cut no corner, in pursuit of the most precious ingredients on the globe. The process would end up taking him 2 years of dedicated work, but the result is nothing short of extraordinary: O Hira, the powerful, authentic scent of fossilized amber, a masterwork that Lucas considers“the diamond of the collection.”There is no fragrance pyramid in O Hira, no notes given to consider outside of fossilized amber. But hidden within the simplicity is breathtaking depth, an amber that seems to contain sweet, rich, warm, spicy, powdery and smoky all at once, the kind of amber that almost makes one wonder if they're actually smelling it for the first time. With an almost unbelievable sillage and longevity, O Hira is a true testament to uncompromising quality, an approach mirrored in the elegant, genuine platinum-lettered bottle and hand-milled silver cap. For those who love amber fragrances above all others, O Hira demands to become the centerpiece of your collection.", Fossilized amber,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65506.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Une Nuit a Doha Eau de Parfum,1579,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777," While the 777 line is dedicated to paying tribute to the great cultures and natural ingredients of the Middle East, StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas is in no way fenced in by the conventions or styles of traditional middle eastern perfumery. And we're thankful for that, because Une Nuit Ã€ Doha, a soft, deliciously sweet immortelle and vanilla scent inspired by summer nights in the capital of Qatar, is nobody's idea of an indulgently rich Middle Eastern gourmand.Instead, it glows like a hazy, dreamlike moon, calm but deep, on a city night where the intensity of the day's heat has faded but not vanished. Warm winds carry the exotic scents of night markets: fennel, ginger, crystallized mandarin, while the sweetness of the immortelle blends into a comfortable brown tobacco from the neighborhood cafes, where games and conversations amongst old men run late into the night. As the base of creamy, beautiful vanilla absolute begins to warm, the fragrance hugs closer to the skin, drawing people together as the desert night seems to stretch on into eternity. This is seduction for adults- calm, assured, and utterly lovely.Presented in a genuine gold-lettered transparent bottle, adorned with a unique hand-milled gold honeycomb top and a small faceted peach-colored Swarovski crystal."," Fennel, crystallized mandarin, ginger, immortelle flower from Corsica, vetiver from HaÃ¯ti, brown tobacco, absolute of vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65508.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Magnolia Grandiflora - Sandrine Eau de Parfum,2262,Grandiflora," Perfume lovers have long admired the author of the fiercely original Manoumalia, Sandrine Videault, a maverick artist who chose to work only on compositions she believed in, hence her tiny commercial production. Sandrine left us last year at a tragically early age. Her last gift to us, and to the Australian floral designer Saskia Havekes, whose soul and world Sandrine fell in love with, is her Magnolia Grandiflora.Magnolia Grandiflora Sandrine is part of a pair of fragrances, both dedicated to Grandiflora's namesake blossom. An unusual debut for a fledgling brand, but a vibrant, emotional tribute to the story behind the scents, since the other magnolia was composed by Michel Roudnitska, the son of Sandrine's mentors, Edmond and ThÃ©rÃ¨se. While Michel's magnolia is lush and sensuous, this fragrance captures magnolia on a summer morning in its first, luminous stage: a dewy rose-tinged bud, shimmering with the tangy zest of a grapefruit note.“It's probably the first time I detect a chypre accord in the flower”, Sandrine wrote.“I didn't know it existed in nature. For me, it was the most important thing to say about this Magnolia. Of course, this flower smells of lemon, and also conjures a certain moistness, but there are also fruity notes of melon, watermelon, earthy notes, etc.”A pure, graceful fragrance with a zest for life."," Lemon, grapefruit, white pepper, fresh garden accords, dry wood accords, marine-aquatic accords, musky accords",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64201.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vani Choc Eau de Parfum,2212,Hilde Soliani," Vani Choc opens with a sparkling burst of lemon and bergamot, like fresh zested rind stirred into a bowl of vanilla, cream, and sugar. The citrus gradually melts into warm Madagascar vanilla and soft sandalwood. The result is an elegant gourmand - a rich creme caramel with subtle sugared cocoa and almond facets. Vani Choc is creamy, comforting and as can be imagined-- a dessert-inspired concoction that begs you to keep sniffing your wrists. It's unquestionably sweet, but the richness of vanilla is perfectly balanced with clean citrus and grounding wood notes. It's classic Hilde Soliani - a delicious, uplifting and addictive treat."," Citrus accord, vanilla, almond, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46629.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tendre est la Nuit Eau de Parfum,2039,Majda Bekkali," Soft, aromatic, and animalic, Tendre est la Nuit evokes a cozy and sweet atmosphere that may result in indolence and languor. Majda Bekkali,“wanted to tell what may be the opposite of the noisy and turbulent world where we live...but when we extract ourselves from the noisy world, some danger lurks around and reason falters, the animality emerges.” An homage to Zelda Fitzgerald (wife of F. Scott) who not only hid in the shadows of her husband, but also in her own cocoon of madness, Tendre Est La Nuit is a scent that references darkness' magnetic appeal and the sweet idleness of a wandering mind.Created with perfumer Delphine Thierry, the top notes of immortelle flower and ambrette resemble the intoxication of GewÃ¼rztraminer wine; herbaceous davana and bright pepper notes serve as a lovely contrast to the mahogany, incense, and animalic notes that make an impression of danger that lurks around in the shadows of the night."," Corsican immortelle, ambrette and carrot seeds, cabreuva, davana, pepper, Sichuan pepper, benzoin, leather, labdanum, oakmoss, incense, patchouli, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Monsieur Eau de Parfum,2849,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection," Monsieur is inspired by the exploration of a forest, where torrents and waterfalls from Auvergne's mountains carry along scents of moss, bark, wood, earth, and stone.  A harmonious blend of eight woody notes entwined with crushed leaves splashed by the mineral freshness of water spurting out of the rock.  Monsieur is a powerful, complex, and vibrant scent permeated with an organic sensuality.  It is both dry and green, mixing elements of grass, earth, crisp air currents, and damp stones.  Vetiver lovers will savor the soil-caked purity of the scent and wood aficionados will appreciate the elegant blend of poplar, cedar, and sandalwood - a true harmony of the forest in a fragrance."," Patchouli, Cedarwood, Vetiver and Sandalwood, Absolute of Poplar, Oakmoss, Incense Wood and Papyrus.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/54513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ashoka Eau de Parfum,2582,Neela Vermeire Creations," Inspired by a legendary ruler, Neela Vermeire's Ashoka, is a tribute to an emperor who was conquered by his own compassion at the moment his victory was assured. He converted to Buddhism and devoted the rest of his life to spreading the Buddha's teachings, to truth, to justice and to compassion for all living creatures beneath the sun. His own evolution from ruthless conqueror to benevolent emperor is reflected in Ashoka's journey from the fierce opening to a softly floral heart & the gentle embrace of its richly complex dry down.Ashoka is many things at once - it melds green, milky, earthy, and watery floral notes into one enticing and multifaceted scent.  The opening is a refreshing fig leaf, hyacinth, and lotus - but as soon as you think that the scent is all watery and green, the creamy and earthy personality capture you like quicksand - pulling you in and helping you discover fig milk, osmanthus, heliotrope, sandalwood, and a hint of vanilla.  These notes provide a velvety lactic quality that is altogether unexpected and totally irresistible.  The polarities of water and milk are not only perfectly balanced, but also enhanced and expanded by exotic florals of yang-ylang and jasmine, and grounding and robust notes of leather and vetiver.  Ashoka is a brilliant scent for both men and women looking for a complex yet comforting scent to be worn year-round."," Lotus, rose, water hyacinth, fig leaf, parsley leaf, Osmanthus absolute, cassie absolute, iris, incense essence, Jasmine sambac, fig milk, geranium, ylang-ylang, Fir balsam absolute, myrrh, cedarwood, sandalwood, vanilla accord, ambre gris, birch, Haitian vetiver, leather, styrax, heliotrope",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56504.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cologne Absolute Eau de Parfum,2786,Tom Daxon," As the name would suggest, Cologne Absolute is Tom Daxon's take on a classic cologne, a fragrance at once supremely respectful of tradition and not at all beholden to it.  A beautifully rendered vision of soaring neroli layered with tart citrus, sharp aromatics and soft white flowers over an earthy base of patchouli and cypriol, Cologne Absolute conjures up the delightful feel of a jaunt to Italy in summertime; an easy, relaxed well-being that brightens and invigorates. It's fresh and sparkling and sunny. Unlike traditional colognes, however, Tom has taken these elements and distilled them into an Eau de Parfum strength elixir that keeps that magical, neroli-drenched sunshine lasting well into the evening hours."," Neroli, bergamot, tarragon, green violet leaf, lemon petitgrain, jasmine, lily of the valley, givescone, patchouli, cypriol",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sicilian Wood Eau de Parfum,1263,Tom Daxon," Inspired by the scent of a citrus grove warming in the sun, Sicilian Wood is a quintessential Tom Daxon fragrance: powerfully evocative, fascinating in its evolution and, ultimately, equal parts surprising and satisfying. The opening is a vivid citrus that is instantly captivating.  The blend of lemon, tangerine and bergamot is startlingly realistic – you can feel that little squirt of juice as you peel off the skin of a tangerine.  There is a hint of sweetness – like freshly-squeezed orange juice – as we move to a blend of gentle lily of the valley and jasmine.  Then strong, resolute cedar and sandalwood appear and the soul of the fragrance is revealed: rich, confident wood with a twist of citrus."," Lemon, tangerine, bergamot, cardamom, gaiac wood, jasmine, lily of the valley, amber cedarwood, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Resin Sacra Eau de Parfum,2981,Tom Daxon," A meditation on the beauty of the ambiguous nature of frankincense.  An evocative shape-shifter, this tantalizing blend takes advantage of the diversity of its central ingredient to offer an experience both cool and church-like, and warm and sensual. A honeyed suede – sweet, soft and rich – cradles the frankincense as it emerges, creating an air of delicious opulence as resinous swirls of benzoin and cistus meld with the frankincense, leading it away from the gothic chill of stone and ceremony and celebrating its mesmerizing sensuality. And yet as the fragrance warms on the skin, the sweetness becomes less pronounced, and the transporting, ethereal side of frankincense emerges. We never cross fully to the sacred side, but those aspects of this compelling note keep the luxury in balance. Gorgeous and mystical."," Suede, frankincense, patchouli, benzoin Siam, cistus, ambroxan, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Iridium Eau de Parfum,2258,Tom Daxon," We don't know what fragrance James Bond tends to wear, but we're certain he'd make room in his rotation for Iridium. After all, just like the legendary super-spy himself, this genuinely elegant scent has a subtle, dangerously complex secret identity. Iridium opens with a cool martini-like blast of juniper. A teaser of carrot seed and angelica introduces a silvery iris. Gliding in as sleekly as a pristine 1964 Aston Martin DB5, the natural root-like earthiness gives way to a bracing glint of metal. A base of understated cedar and the enigmatic but irresistible Iso E Super adds warmth and depth. Iridium may be soft spoken, but never underestimate the seductive power hiding just beneath the surface."," Juniper, angelica, carrot seed, iris, vetiver, cedarwood, Iso E Super",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Salvia Sclarea Eau de Parfum,2350,Tom Daxon," A sweeping wind of brilliant spring green. Salvia sclarea is the botanical name for clary sage, and this fragrance is built around an outstanding clary sage note - clear, sparkling, with a touch of sweetness - blended with crisp grass and cool violet leaves to further deepen the sensation of endless green fields. The effect is not an orderly, manicured lawn, but rather a wild meadow, sprinkled with wildflowers and wet with dew. It is intensely, joyously, vibrantly green. Jasmine adds a clean floral freshness and oak moss, cashmeran and musk add a layer of velvety softness underneath, acting as supporting players in this ode to an early summer morning. Gorgeous, fresh and calming."," Grass, green violet leaf, bergamot, elemi, clary sage, jasmine, oakmoss, cashmeran, white musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Agua Magnoliana Eau de Parfum,2263,Fueguia 1833," A glorious abundance of magnolia. The scent of the magnolia is delicate and intoxicating – clean and brisk with a squeeze of citrus and a honeyed sweetness on top. This fragrance is a tribute to Magnolia Amazonica -- the guardian trees of the Amazonian rainforests. They grow over 60 feet high and their luminous white flowers open at night, disseminating their euphoric scent in a dreamy tropical haze.  Imagine a hot and starry night when all of the thousands of fragile blossoms on the oversized tree unfurl their petals at the very same time, releasing an exuberant wave of transporting scent. Jasmine adds her flirtatious headiness to the mix and Indian sandalwood adds just enough warmth and weight to keep the whole thing from floating off into the ether like an escaped balloon. Agua Magnolia achieves that perfect balance of clean and sweet that we look for in a white floral. Ridiculously pretty.Agua Magnolia is from the Linneo collection, named in honor of Carl Linnaeus, a poet who became a naturalist. Each fragrance in this collection highlights a native South American plant."," Amazon magnolia, Santalum Album, grandiflorum jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Talc Gourmand Eau de Parfum,1856,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," Much like the indulgent desserts from which they draw inspiration, the best gourmand fragrances are deceptively complex, combining familiar notes in precise order to achieve something transcendent. And just as it takes years to train a master pastry chef, the expertise required to create a masterful gourmand knows no shortcut. So gourmand lovers everywhere should rejoice at the introduction of Talc Gourmand, the newest addition from a historic apothecary with a distinguished reputation for mouthwatering gourmand scents. Top notes of powdery talc and sweet caramel give way to a warm and luxuriously creamy vanilla and chocolate center. A sandalwood base adds richness and complexity in just the right proportion, ensuring that you won't have to wait until after your meal to enjoy this perfect indulgence."," Honey, caramel, vanilla flower, talcum powder, heliotrope, chocolate, tonka bean, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44016.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Orgasmo Eau de Parfum,2967,Hilde Soliani," A swoon-inducing almond elixir that opens with a splash of Amaretto on the rocks.  Amaretto is the beloved Italian almond-flavored liqueur whose name means“a little bitter”, which it definitely is. However, it is also a little sweet, with a cherry-like fruitiness that counters the bitterness. That elusive bittersweet quality is at the heart of almond's appeal and is the centerpiece of this compelling scent. The almond note is full and complex, stepping forward after the intoxicating sweetness of the opening subsides. There is a creamy, dough-like quality underneath – not sugary cookie dough, but rich and buttery bread dough laced with almonds and fruit, with a whisper of salt. There are many elements of a comfort scent here, but the insistent, tantalizing thrum of almond's dark side keeps this enticingly dangerous.  An undercurrent of dry, cool wood gives this the dusky feel of rough velvet and distant smoke.  According to Hilde, this was inspired by drinking iced almond coffee on the beach with good friends. All we can say is that must have been some really special coffee and some really nice friends, because this sensuous scent evokes a feeling of true euphoria. Orgasmo has that hypnotic effect where you always want to take one more sniff... just one more. A must have for almond lovers."," almond, amaretto liqueur accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46626.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
J'ai Fait Un Reve - Obscur Eau de Parfum,2309,Majda Bekkali," Eclectic and extraordinary, J'ai Fait Un RÃªve Pour Lui (formerly Songe pour Lui) is confident in its oppositions and perfectly at ease with taking any expectations you might have from reading its notes and blowing ”˜em all sky high.

J'ai Fait Un Reve - Clair Eau de Parfum,1993,Majda Bekkali," Both deep and ethereal, J'ai Fait Un RÃªve is like falling into dream. The opening is the sweet descent, a gentle fall down, down, down, with the smell of orange-like notes and orange blossom trailing along. The dream shifts, with a warm jasmine twisting sensually on a bed of precious woods and light incense, and the pulse is taken up a notch with labdanum, cumin and leather. Before things get too heated, an illuminating white musk begins to weave in, imbuing the fragrance with soft, clean notes and creating a sense of contentment and happiness. No dark edges here, just a wonderful center with depth around which a light musk swirl and dances without a care."," Petitgrain, elemi, cumin, currant leaves, orange blossom, jasmine, lisylang, castoreum, white musk, white cedar, guaiac, leather, labdanum, incense and papyrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fusion Sacree - Clair Eau de Parfum,1493,Majda Bekkali," Fusion SacreÃ© for her is a bewitching elixir from the hands of L'Artisan's main nose, Bertrand Duchaufour. The opening is a little unexpected, with hints of blackcurrant and citrusy bergamot and clementine tinged with coffee, a note that comes out more as the perfume melds with your skin. Heady florals like gardenia, jasmine and orange blossom meet their match with a deep base of fir, cedar, and patchouli. It's then that this beautiful brew unveils its soul as it revels in the push/pull of opposing force, letting each of the notes unfold before evolving to something new. A sweet vanilla finish is expertly tampered with benzoin and musk creating a warm, radiating finish that is so smooth it inspires half-lidded eyes and reverie.","fir, cedar, patchouli, jasmine, orange blossom, vanilla, musk, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60102.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fusion Sacree - Obscur Eau de Parfum,2316,Majda Bekkali," L'Artisan's Bertrand Duchaufour is the nose behind Fusion SacreÃ© for him, and his masterful hand has created a perfume so deep, warm and boozy-woody thick/sweet that our eyes rolled back in our heads and we started muttering incoherently. It opens with a flourish of opulent spices and a brush of lavender...but it's quickly bowled over by an aged wooden cask of rum. It's a big, bold frigate ship of a fragrance, its wild and unbridled boozy notes enriched by coffee, spiked by cloves, sweetened by vanilla & caramel, and touched with tuberose. Narcotic and emotional, if it were a color, it would be dark brown and resinous... slow-flowing and teeth-grindingly delicious."," Rum, citron, celery, sweet orange, neroli, cardamom, lavender, davana, bergamot, white coffee, tuberose absolute, cloves, geranium, sweet william pear, liquorice, benzoin resinoid, opoponax resinoid, ambergris, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, caramel and musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Platino,1525,Omnia Profumo," A transcendently light almond-infused meringue drizzled with coconut, caramel and vanilla.  Platino is definitely delicious, but it is also frothy and airy, which is unexpected given the rich dessert-like notes it incorporates. The luscious blend of gourmand elements is buoyed by exquisitely delicate jasmine and mimosa and the result is a dreamy cloud cake that floats effortlessly over the drudgery of the everyday world, trailing a gentle puff of powder.  This is not a simple bonbon, but a confection of the highest order, intricately layered to seduce and delight us. The insistent hint of bitterness from the almond counters the sugary caramel and the cool filigree of white flowers balances the cozy warmth of the soft musk.  Delectable and comforting , but with enough contradictions to keep us intrigued for a very long time."," Whipped cream, coconut, caramel, almond milk, jasmine, mimosa, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46108.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'homme infini Eau de Parfum,1163,Divine," Yann Vasnier has a history of creating outstanding men's scents for Divine, and L'homme infini, his latest creation for the line, does not disappoint. Resolutely masculine and warmly reassuring, this has the confident ease of a man who has all the time in the world, surveying the vast horizon to see the next adventure ahead.  The opening is an effervescent and distinctive blend of green and spice, featuring coriander (both leaf and grain), elemi and a very present black pepper. There is a lovely invigorating sparkle that reminds us of freshly chopped ginger that continues to tingle and fizz even as the heart of oak, cedar and agar wood reveals itself. The woods are majestic and gorgeous – a rich and resinous forest out of legend. Oak, cedar and agar wood layer warmth, strength and a hint of mystery. Vetiver adds a dry earthiness which plays well with the lingering pepperiness, while amber and benzoin bring out the warm, burnished glow of the wood. Elegant and nuanced, this is a scent of endless possibilities, suitable for both the serene lord of the manor and the swashbuckling stranger that swaggers up to challenge his claim."," Coriander leaf and grain, elemi, black pepper, oak, cedar, agar wood, vetiver, amber, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22711.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Cristina Eau de Parfum,2295,Hilde Soliani," Hilde Soliani's Cristina is part of her Gli Invisibili collection, and aptly so, as the scent is a subtle, comforting cloak of earth and amber like a guardian angel.  Cristina is named after one of Hilde's best friends, who loved the fragrance so much that she became the namesake.  Appropriately, the theme of friendship and duality is prevalent in the fragrance. Cristina combines two types of rare patchouli as essential ingredients in the composition; each bringing out the best in the other. The patchouli notes in Cristina have a subtle feeling of Incense and Oud-like familiarity, as if they possess the wisdom of multiple lifetimes. Vanilla and cistus labdanum provide the comforting heart of the fragrance, acting as the glowing center upon which the duet of patchouli thrives. Cristina defies all expectation of a patchouli fragrance, and even those that thought they were not patchouli lovers will be proven wrong."," Patchouli, labdanum, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46625.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Poudre de Riz Eau de Parfum,2872,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection," Inspired by a line in the 1908 novel L'Enfer by Henri Barbusse...“The air in the disordered shuttered room was heavy with a mixture of odours: Soap, face powder, the sharp tang of cologne...”Poudre de Riz is a soft insinuating blend of rose petals, rice powder, monoi flowers and vanilla. Nostalgic and sensuous it conjures up the langour and luxury of Edwardian afternoons, the scent of beautiful clothes and elegant rooms permeated with rare and exotic flowers. Powdery, creamy and tactile but with an intriguing retro charm."," Damask rose, tiare absolute, coconut, vanilla, rice powder accord (caramelic, burnt toast and maple notes), sandalwood, iris, cedar, tonka bean, Tolu balsam and benzoin resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/54512.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
450 Eau de Parfum,2372,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," If we could smell the woods, meadows and flower garlands depicted in Sandro Botticelli's Primavera, their spring beauty might very well resemble 450 by Farmacia SS Annunziata, named after the 450 Jubilee of the ancient Farmacia, which was established in the year of 1561 in the San Nicolo monastery.450 gives the impression of being a rustic floral, the marriage of its notes joined together by the wind and sealed with kisses from the sun. With its brisk, aromatic citrus top notes, light rosy floral heart tempered by woods, and its ambery-musky base with a touch of incense, 450 is spring in all its rawness, freshness, and warmth. In the drydown, woodsy florals are softened by Florentine orris with its powdery, earthy gentleness and the ambery-vanillic sweetness of coumarin.A perfect unisex fragrance for hot weather, 450 could easily adorn (and cool off) the wearer of a seersucker suit or a white linen dress.

The splendid heart of oud and leather is gently softened by cedar and patchouli, giving it a comforting and resinous appeal. Savory pepper notes give this scent a masculine edge, and notes of orange and grapefruit perk it up, bringing it out of the agarwood forest and into the light. As it develops on the skin, Emir reveals a softer side of geranium and white musk, rounding out its olfactory composition perfectly. The ideal blend of oud, smoke, sweet, and spice, Emir is the perfect distinctive masculine fragrance to wear anytime, for any occasion."," orange, grapefruit, geranium, oud, black pepper, patchouli, cedarwood, leather, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24529.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bombay Bling Eau de Parfum,2256,Neela Vermeire Creations," ""This joyful creation embodies every aspect of the very modern, colorful, eclectic, esoteric, ecstatic, liberal, happy side of buzzing India"", Neela Vermeire explains. And what a buzz Bombay Bling is, starting with the bang of a huge, raspy green mango before exploding into a vibrant, tropical blend of jasmine, tuberose, ylang-ylang, plumeria and gardenia.This extravagantly lavish bouquet is rooted in wood and tobacco notes, which give it an intriguing hint of masculinity. Lads who feel they can rock white florals could give this a try. Ladies who want to unleash their inner Bollywood diva will look no further. Bottle design allows for either splash or atomizer spray (included)"," Mango, lychee, blackcurrant, cardamom, cumin, cistus, Turkish rose, jasmine sambac, ylang-ylang, tuberose, plumeria, gardenia, patchouli, tobacco, sandalwood, cedar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mohur Eau de Parfum,2808,Neela Vermeire Creations," The name refers to the most valuable gold coin in India's history, the last of which was minted in 1918. A way, perhaps, of underlining the value given to perfumery during the Mogul era, an art so highly considered that the most powerful empress of the Mughal dynasty, Noor Jahan, devoted herself to perfecting it.Though Mohur is built on the classic Eastern accord of rose and oud, with its powdery orris accords it also manages to conjure the opulence of classic French fragrances. It is also, despite the richness of its floral accords, a unisex scent, with leather effects alluding to high tea after a polo match in the British Raj, and perhaps a whiff of fine-milled English soap.But the real surprise in Mohur is the subtle Indian pastry accord tucked in the petals of its rose garden, with notes of carrot, almond, cardamom and ambrette, lending a tender touch to this majestic composition. If Patou had been Indian, this would have been Joy...Bottle design allows for either splash or atomizer spray (included)"," Cardamom, coriander, ambrette, carrot, black pepper, elemi,  Turkish rose oil, jasmine, orris, hawthorn, almond milk accord, leather, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, oudh Palao from Laos, benzoin, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56501.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Trayee Eau de Parfum,2461,Neela Vermeire Creations," The name means ""triad"", an allusion to the sacred origin of the first three Vedas, the most ancient sacred texts in India. The notes are drawn from the ingredients used in religious rituals and ayurvedic medicine during the Vedic era. Rich in incense, myrrh and oud, the fragrance is a poignant blend of smoke, spices and resins that harks back to the very origins of perfumery ”” a burnt offering to the gods and an aid to meditation.Bertrand Duchaufour has always excelled at bringing transparency to dark resinous notes, and he surpasses himself in the smoky blend: Trayee is amazingly facetted, with green (basil, cardamom, cassis), floral (jasmine), spicy (ginger, cinnamon, clove), leather (saffron, oud), smoky (vetiver, sandalwood) and balsamic (myrrh, vanilla) effects, dominated by the quintessentially Indian fragrances of sandalwood and jasmine. The perfumer has even added an arrestingly realistic ganja accord, a memory of the sadus he ran across during his trips in India.Trayee's smoky tendrils may not have consciousness-altering effects, but we suspect that the gorgeous natural materials in the formula might be aromatherapeutic. Beauty heals."," Blue ginger, elemi, cinnamon, ganja accord, blackcurrant absolute, basil, jasmine sambac, Egyptian jasmine, cardamom absolute, clove, saffron, Javanese and Haitian vetiver, incense, Mysore sandalwood oil, patchouli, myrrh, vanilla, cedar, amber notes, oud palao from Laos, oak moss.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Myrrhiad Eau de Parfum,1185,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection," The amazingly prolific Pierre Guillaume adds a ninth scent to HuitiÃ¨me Art, a line dedicated to rare natural organic ingredients and original accords based on novel“plant captures”. But this time, instead of pear tree bark or organic Moroccan verbena, he tackles one of the most ancient and sacred aromatic ingredients known to mankind: myrrh.Myrrh resin is an olfactory world in itself, with bitter, ambery and balsamic facets. Guillaume, who has always had a bent for gourmand notes, amplifies those facets by matching them with a cocktail of vanillas to boost the balsamic effects. The cool burn of licorice draws the blend towards mouth-watering darkness shot with green glints of anise and milky almond plushness.But the real surprise springs from the splash of black tea absolute that soaks the bittersweet potion with smoky, tarry, almost animalic effects, and turn into a gloriously dark, smooth leather scent.Myrrhiad conjures the sacred and erotic origins of perfume. Whether you wear it to connect with your inner Wise Man or priestess, or for a seduction ritual, is entirely up to you."," Myrrh, black tea absolute, vanilla, licorice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/54510.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oro Eau de Parfum,2594,Omnia Profumo," The power of gold (oro) has tugged at the human soul for millennia, bringing with it intense emotions and indescribable beauty and artistry. Translating gold's majesty and possibilities from the senses of touch and sight to smell was a Herculean task, and one Omnia Profumo spared no expense in doing. Oro is a shaded glen dappled with golden light, scented with light touches of fresh lemon and bergamot that meld with a breeze carrying a zingy, wild cyclamen. The breeze picks up with a gust of peony, lavender and spring lilac, and bids farewell as a rich and sensual vanilla/patchouli combination unfolds. The vanilla-like coumarin and exquisite sandalwood are perfect accompaniments-- you didn't think a perfume called Oro would be a coquettish giggle of a perfume, right?  Don't assume it's overly heavy or ostentatious; Oro is feminine and sexy without trying too hard, that just-right combo of sweet and dark that will have people running the wrong way down an escalator to ask you what you're wearing."," Lemon, Bergamot, Cyclamen, Lavender, Lilac, Peony, Patchouly Sandalwood, Coumarin, Incense, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Conaffetto Eau de Parfum,1395,Hilde Soliani," A delightful, romantic filigree of almonds, sugar and soaringly lovely orange blossom. Created for a dear friend's wedding, Soliani was inspired by“confetti” – the sugar coated almond candies served at weddings in Italy – and around the world.  You may know them better as Jordan almonds. This is not an easy, melt-in-your-mouth sort of candy. The sugarcoating is to convey the wish that the newlyweds' life be more sweet than bitter and the beauty of these candies is that the almonds really do have a sharp bitterness that contrasts with the powdery sweetness. That beguiling contradiction is captured perfectly in this scent and leads into an absolutely gorgeous profusion of fresh orange blossoms, as if you were walking under a wedding bower.  Conafetto features an absolutely radiant version of fleur d'oranger – a touch of honey, a touch of citrus and a bounty of ethereal white flowers. We can't imagine a more perfect scent for a wedding – but you don't need to be a bride to love this. Any time you want to dab on a dose of sheer joy, this would be appropriate."," Orange blossom, almond, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46614.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Patchouli Nobile Eau de Parfum,2267,Nobile 1942," Let's face it: Patchouli can be maddening to describe because it smells like nothing else in the world but patchouli. Yes, it's earthy and rich, but those adjectives fail to conjure up the hypnotic, evocative qualities that make patchouli so distinctive. Luckily, if we simply state the obvious – Patchouli Nobile is a patchouli scent – we have a good place to begin because we all know that deep, highly recognizable note. The question is, is it a good patchouli scent? Happily, the answer is yes. In fact, it's not just a good patchouli scent, it's a great one: It seduces without resorting to brute force, it has a caressing amber-tinged sweetness that nestles into the loamy richness of clean earth and smooth wood and it retains the dry freshness of its opening of incense and pepper. It is both elegantly refined and devastatingly sexy. The patchouli is absolutely present, but it's not overpowering, and the layers of sandalwood, oak moss, amber and tonka add a luxurious, velvety quality that makes this superbly wearable. It goes without saying that if you are already a fan of patchouli, you need to try this, but we feel that this cozy and alluring scent has the potential to win new converts to the patchouli cult, as well. Outstanding."," Citrus, white pepper, frankincense, patchouli, gaic wood, cistus, jasmine Moroccan cedarwood, amber, oak moss, sandalwood, tonka.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Estroverso Eau de Parfum,1935,Nobile 1942," A sparkling burst of lemon, orange and tangerine gives this lively scent an opening as dazzling as the sun bursting through clouds. Estroverso is a combination of estro – the Italian word of inspiration and intuition – and verso (against)  -- and it is meant to convey that drive to follow inspiration against all odds. It is the passion of invention and creation, and that stubborn streak that compels you to pursue your dreams even when things look hopeless. The vivid citrus and herbs dance over a complex mÃ©lange of vetiver, ambergris, cedar and musk. This has the classic eau de cologne structure, but  heightened. The citrus is extra bright and the base is rich and complex. And there is a little bit of something edgy in there; we are assuming it's the mugwort, because it is what we would imagine a plant with startling healing properties and possible magical applications would smell like – green and potent. Overall, a scintillating potion that will keep you upbeat and alert while waiting for inspiration to strike."," Lemon, Orange, Tangerine, Lime, Rosemary, Mugwort, Cedarwood, Vetiver, Patchouly, Musk, Ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambra Nobile Eau de Parfum,2916,Nobile 1942," A classic amber scent, impeccably done. Warm, powdery and  soothing. A fresh citrus and orange blossom opening leads us to the heart of ambergris, labdanum and patchouli. There is a startling hint of salt and stone in the transition and, though we quickly move past that into a smooth and comforting blend of tonka bean, vetiver, cedar and sandalwood, there is something intriguingly solid and cool beneath all the warm elements. This is a fragrance with presence: It has a soft, satisfying sweetness, but it's not candied or syrupy. It's calming, but it feels much too sophisticated to describe it as cozy. The word that leaps to mind is regal. It feels as if this was created for the exclusive use of nobility and we managed to sneak a bottle out of the palace for ourselves. Don't we all deserve to be treated like royalty sometimes? Pure elegance."," Neroli, Bergamot, Ambergris, Labdanum, Patchouly, Tonka Bean, Sandalwood, Cedarwood, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Note Vanillee Eau de Parfum,2728,M. Micallef," We usually think of vanillas as of good girl scents, cozy scents, comforting scents... Micallef's Note Vanillee, with its impish licorice accord and a boozy undertone of cognac and rum is a girl gone bad, very, very bad. We can't get enough of the honeyed piquancy of the perfume, with its juicy mandarin and its seductive jasmine; the base of sandalwood, vanilla and smoky, sweet tobacco, rum and cognac is sinfully delicious. Micallef celebrates the fragrance“Note VanillÃ©e” in its new Art Collection, exclusively available at Luckyscent. The flacon is decorated with clear crystals and the exquisite silver-colored cap completes the touch of elegance that radiates from the flacon. It is more than a flacon, more than a perfume; it is a unique creation, a work of art."," mandarin, jasmine, honey, licorice, sandalwood, vanilla, cognac, rum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24511.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Beachwood Eau de Parfum,1113,Costamor," Costa Rica translates to rich coast and no perfume theme built around the country could be without a fragrant valentine to its amazing coastline. Beachwood moves away from the tourist hotspots and takes you to a sheltered cove on a protected beach.  A crescent of white sand backs up against a forested cliff while aquamarine water glistens and rolls and the clean, untouched aquatic notes fill the air. The subtle hints of jasmine, neroli and coconut serve notice that you are indeed in a tropical landscape, and woods, lavender and bergamot remind you of the forest on the cliffs.  Light, effortless and calm, Beachwood is light and easy to wear- making it a perfect choice for an everyday fragrance."," Bergamot, Mandarin, Neroli, Jasmine, Coconut, Cedar wood, Sandalwood, Amber, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sugarwood Eau de Parfum,1550,Costamor," A soft, woody--almost gourmand-like perfume-- with a surprise twist: the sweet and strikingly fresh scent of newly cut sugar cane. Sugar cane is a cultivated crop in Costa Rica but it thrives so well in the idyllic climate that you find it growing wild, ready to be savored on a whim. This cherished treat inspired Sugarwood, which features sugar cane pulp as a primary note. Luscious fig complements the sweetness, while warm cedar evokes the woody aspect of the plant. Gentle floral notes - ethereal jasmine, lilting peony and a powdery iris - meld beautifully to create a feminine scent that is the ideal balance of sweet and sophisticated."," Bergamot, fig, sugar cane pulp, peony, jasmine, musk, iris, vanilla, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau Divine Eau de Parfum,2116,Divine," The ninth fragrance by Divine sees this estimable house introduce its first unisex eau de parfum. As the name would imply, Eau Divine perfectly balances the bracing freshness of an eau with the warm sensuality that characterizes the Divine fragrances. Masculine and feminine, tender and sharp, this play of opposites achieves a perfect unity. Imagine an intricately carved Waterford crystal goblet. The beveled clarity captures and refracts pure light while the vessel sits with impressive weight in your hand. When you strike the lead crystal to propose a toast, it resonates with an impeccable purity. Eau Divine begins with a sunny blast of Italian citrus and orange blossom with spicy notes of ginger, nutmeg and star anise gently hovering in the periphery. The scintillating start begins to settle, allowing the warmth of violet to emerge. Seductive traces of amber and labdanum lead the journey into a candle-lit enclave bounded by draped velvet.  Unpredictable and complex, Eau Divine is a sophisticated fragrance perfectly suited for a man or woman of utter refinement."," Green mandarin, star anise, ginger, nutmeg, orange flower, violet, cardamom, white amber, labdanum, hot musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Il Vs Iris Eau de Parfum,1658,Hilde Soliani," Il Vs Iris, Hilde Soliani's ode to the precious flower, might be the most charming take on iris. The most surprising too, because the soft, child-like initial impression of the scent fools the wearer into believing that it is a simple, uncomplicated blend. .But wait for the fresh, gently rooty floral top notes to subside, and you will be startled by the beautiful dry greenness of the next accord, woody and verdant, a peppery smell of young leaves and twigs. Wait a little longer, and you will see why we believe that this enchanting composition would delight not only lovers of iris, but also fans of almond and heliotrope. The honeyed nuttiness of almond is not too sweet, just enough to make the perfume downy and soft, fluffy, innocent and unexpectedly sensual. Absolutely adorable!"," Orris root, green pepper, almond, sandalwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46610.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Acquiiissssima Eau de Parfum,2358,Hilde Soliani," With Acquiilssssima, Hilde Soliani translates haute cuisine into haute parfumerie. Inspired by a dish created by an Italian chef, the scent blends the salty, mineral, fresh aroma of the sea with green tea and jasmine. Those wary of aquatic scents need not be afraid. The saline, subtly, strangely animalic, seaweedy-green smell of the sea is unmistakable here, but it does not lend the composition that aggressively fresh quality so typical of marine fragrances. The pairing of this verdant saltiness and sweet jasmine petals is unexpected, striking and truly sublime. The watery and the floral aspects of the blend are tied together with a green tea note, which possesses qualities of the both, and which lends Acquiilssssima delicate its translucency and a calm, airy feel. A chef-d'oeuvre!"," seaweed, jasmine, green tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fraaagola Saalaaata Eau de Parfum,1545,Hilde Soliani," Fraaagola Saalaaata, a surprising mix of strawberries and... salt, is a playful, unexpectedly subversive scent, a composition with two sides, sweet and forceful. Elegant and humorous, the perfume is like no other that we know. Try as we might we can't come up with anything like its unique mixture of pulpy, juicy, fruity innocence and strangely saline, at times almost earthy sensuality. Simple and enigmatic, sweet and fresh, summery and deep...This is haute cuisine, or rather haute parfumerie at its absolute best!", Strawberry salt,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46609.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'etre Aime - Femme Eau de Parfum,2758,Divine," At the heart of our lives is a perfume we will never forget, the fragrance of the one we love.  Yvon Mouchel created the 7th addition to the world of Divine around this theme. Linked to its masculine counterpart by the same name, l'Ãªtre aimÃ© femme (”œthe beloved woman”) also shares with it the note that lies in its heart: the everlasting flower with its warm, intense, sunny aroma. The feminine l'Ãªtre aimÃ© enhances the sun-filled quality of helichrysium with the bright, juicy citrus top notes. The dazzling accord of neroli, bergamot and nectarine gracefully leads to the equally radiant bouquet of the middle notes, in which everlasting flowers are mixed with jasmine, lily and rose. The base notes of amber, sandalwood vetiver and vanilla are trademark Divine, lush and elegant, the classic French perfumery at its best."," neroli, bergamot, nectarine, jasmine, lily, tincture of rose, everlasting flowers, labdanum, sandalwood, vetiver and vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambra Eau de Parfum ...,1966,Omnia Profumo," An elegant and dry amber with a sparkling citrus opening. Despite the presence of heavy-hitter base notes like opoponax and patchouli, Ambra feels sheer and refined. The sweetness of the amber and vanilla is balanced with the sharp pepperiness of lavender and a cool, meditative blend of incense notes. This is an amber that is spare, rather than opulent, with a brisk spiciness that complements the sensuous warmth and makes this versatile and easy to wear. If you have been looking for an amber that is wearable day or night and that works in warm weather as well as cool, this is the one. It still has that golden, hypnotic quality that makes amber so addictive, but it is dry and subtle enough to work as an everyday fragrance."," Orange, bergamot, geranium, incense, lavender, patchouli, vanilla, labdanum, opoponax, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Madera Eau de Parfum,2940,Omnia Profumo," Delicious, dreamy caramel. If you are a fan of foodie scents, this is for you. It is a giant vat of golden, buttery caramel goodness ready for you to dip yourself in like a carnival apple. Rich vanilla and creamy coconut give this a hint of Mounds bar yumminess (without the chocolate), and a whipped cream smoothness comes from the soft musk and gentle flowers. But mostly, there is caramel – absolutely decadent and sticky-toffee sweet, comforting and enveloping and warm. This is the gooey center of a delicious candy– molten sugar and cream cooked oh-so-slowly until it magically transforms. We've rarely encountered a scent that captured the lusciousness of caramel so well . As you know, many of the sugar-laced scents and lotions in the mass market veer into the bitter, plasticky realm as they wear on the skin”” but this one miraculously does not. Madera has achieved caramel perfection and stays creamy and delectable all the way through. Truly scrumptious."," Vanilla pod, caramel, Madagascar vanilla, peach blossom, wildflowers, tobacco flower, coconut, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Onice Eau de Parfum ...,2819,Omnia Profumo," Not every fragrance can be described in a line or two – some take a winding path to get to their destination. Onice is one of those fragrances. It opens with a fresh, green, vegetal note. We smell celery, which isn't listed in the notes. Then we get the beginnings of a dense and complicated sweetness that reminds us of immortelle, which is also not listed in the notes. Just when we are about to ignore the notes altogether we get a definite dollop of licorice and a delightfully sweet pineapple – both listed and both very present as they waltz with a variety of partners. Delicate hyacinth, sharp mint, earthy cedar, a dusting of nutmeg. It's an enchanting and unusual journey, that appears to lead to different places for different people– on some Onice is sweet and fruity, on others the green and wood notes dominate. The consensus is that it is light and fresh without being aquatic or soapy or citrus”” and that it is very hard to pin down exactly what it smells like, although we all agree that it smells quite good. Intriguing."," citrus, anise, lavender, licorice, peach, pineapple, rose, nutmeg, geranium, hyacinth, jasmine, ylang, mint, sandalwood, musk, cedarwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46102.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vaniglia del Madagascar Parfum Concentration,1229,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," A classic, full-bodied vanilla – rich, creamy and sweet – that is a prime example of why vanilla scents are so very beloved. A hint of citrus leads to a delectable fruitiness and then it is full-on vanilla in all its luscious, craving-inducing glory. There are a lot of vanilla scented things in the world, but as any passionate vanilla fan will tell you, they are not all created equal. Quality matters, and a finely crafted vanilla scent is as different from the plasticky, mass-marketed versions as leather is from vinyl. It is no surprise that Farmacia SS Annunziata has given us a superlative version that is tantalizingly edible and utterly seductive. Floral grace notes and velvety amber add warmth and complexity, but they are in the mix as supporting players – dreamy, delicious vanilla is the star attraction here, and she deserves her spotlight. A must try for those looking for their Holy Grail vanilla scent."," lemon, floral notes, amber notes, Madagascar vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Reve en Cuir Eau de Parfum,2326,Indult," Reve en Cuir was created by Francis Kurkdjian, the perfumer whose talent and work we admire, as an Indult for Scent Bar fragrance. Knowing our love for leather, you will not be surprised to learn that this Luckyscent exclusive is built on the rich leather accord. The traditional citrusy top notes are given a modern twist by the inclusion of spices, cardamom and cloves, and oregano. Instead of being typically fresh, bergamot and lemon in Reve en Cuir have a delicately candied quality and set the tone of the composition with a rich, indolent feel. Cedar and patchouli enhance the smoky character of the leather while never allowing it to become tarry. Oakmoss and vetiver lend the scent that elegantly earthy character that we adore in classical masculine perfumes, while vanilla compliments the citrusy-spicy side of the blend, softening the sharp angles and making Reve en Cuir indeed dreamy and sensual. Spicy, smoky leather with a dangerously appealing soft side – we fall for that every time. Reve en Cuir was conceived as a masculine creation, but as every woman who has ever borrowed her boyfriend's leather jacket knows – some rules are made to be broken."," Bergamot, Lemon, Cardamom, Oregano, Clove Bud, Texan Cedarwood, Patchouli, Oak Moss, Haitian Vetyver, Crystallized Vanilla Recent Press New York Times' Chandler Burr gives Reve en Cuir  Five Stars'Leather ”” old, dark, smoky, heavy ”” is diabolically difficult to adapt to an accessible 21st-century format. Under the creative direction of Maselli, Wright and Eastwood, Kurkdjian has succeeded masterfully. RÃªve is a delectable, edible, light-infused leather that is instantly legible, deliciously impossible, as if an HermÃ¨s belt had been candied and baked by a patissier. Technically perfect (it lasts and diffuses like clockwork), it is also an aesthetic triumph. HermÃ¨s's own Kelly CalÃ¨che wonderfully modernized leather; RÃªve en Cuir is even better, stronger and more daring.

Patchouly Indonesiano Parfum ...,1926,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," When we got the breakdown of notes for this line, we couldn't help but giggle when we first saw the listing for this fragrance. Head note: Indonesian patchouli, Heart note: Indonesian patchouli, Base note: Indonesian patchouli. But we stopped giggling and started swooning when we sniffed the actual fragrance, because yes – there is that much patchouli in it, and wow--it is absolutely gorgeous. The opening is dry, almost medicinal, then a grand and exotic symphony of dark, chewy sweetness and fresh-tilled earth appear and it is pure, mesmerizing, exotic, no-holds barred, patchouli splendor from that point on. This feels forbidden and irresistible, like an antique trunk full of contraband – but it also has the lush, damp greeness of the forest floor. All of the complexities and contradictions of this enigmatic note - the golden opulence, the herbaceous sharpness – are gloriously present. If you hate patchouli, this will not be your cup of tea.  But if you love it, rejoice--this is one of the most fabulous renditions we have ever encountered. It's the patchouliest!", Patchouli from Indonesia,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambra Nera Parfum ...,2288,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," A regal fragrance that balances the sultry warmth of vanilla and benzoin with icy eucalyptus and dignified cedar. At the center: A cool-headed amber, with all of its passionate excesses in check, but still glowing just below the surface.  Ambra Nera smells powerful and controlled; the delirious sensuality of amber percolates and teases, but never overwhelms the aristocratic architecture of the fragrance. Grounded by earthy vetiver and and dark patchouli, laced with wood, burnished and sweetened by just the right amount of creamy vanilla – this is an amber that is elegant, as well as opulent. Timelessly appealing, this shimmers with the subdued fire of an opal.  A stunning version of one of our favorite notes."," cypress, eucalyptus, amber, benzoin, vetiver, vanilla, patchouly",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chia Eau de Parfum,2685,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," A deliriously extravagant confection of spun-sugar flowers, kissed with citrus and filled with marzipan. Flirtatious and delicious, Chia wears its giddy, candied heart on its sleeve and revels proudly in its unabashed sweetness.  The opening spins candy floss, orange and a soft, powdery rose into a shimmering gossamer strand that wraps around the sweet almond note that takes center stage. A luscious blend of hazelnut, vanilla, and musk adds creaminess and depth, but never overpowers the almond or the flourishes of candy coated rose that give this the feel of a very elegant and rare candy. Charming and delectable."," almond, orange, rose, candyfloss, hazelnut, vanilla, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cara Eau de Parfum,2000,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," Like taking a bite out of a meringue – the initial sugar crystal sweetness that melts into soft vanilla on your tongue, the powdery sensation of chewing the puffy white cloud of a cookie, the striking combination of richness and delicacy. Cara takes some of our favorite gourmand notes – sweet almond, golden caramel and milky vanilla – and makes them soft and airy by folding in dusky amber and talcum. The marshmallow sweet opening mellows into a dreamy vanilla-tinged veil of powder that melts into the skin, soothing and delicious. This is as comforting as a favorite cashmere throw, yet sophisticated enough to qualify as utterly grown up. The perfect thing to reach for when facing a thunderstorm or the possibility of running into an ex. Gentle and delicious, this is a must try for fans of vanilla or almond."," Amber, caramel, almond, talcum, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Takis Eau de Parfum,1033,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," Streamlined and modern.  Dazzlingly sharp lemon and peppery sage set the stage with a brisk, take-no-prisoners policy, and a clean musk and straightforward rose sweep through with equal efficiency. But when a majestic blend of velvety vanilla, exotic ylang ylang and mellow aged oak rolls in, everything slows down and brisk, angular edges are transformed into the smooth, burnished lines of a contemporary sculpture.  Rounded and warm, with a sweet soapiness that is at once familiar and brand new -- like a new, improved soapiness that is a little bit spicier, a little bit creamier, a little bit more of everything we like about soap. Takis can range from a heightened skin scent to seductive night-on-the town scent once it settles in, depending on the chemistry of the wearer. Sophisticated and polished."," Lemon, thyme, sage, rose, musk, ylang ylang, vanilla, oak",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Perla Eau de Toilette,2538,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561," A lovely yellow lemon drop – the perfect blend of sour and sweet  -- melts into a shimmering apricot glow as dollops of fluffy vanilla float by, like the pink tinged clouds of a fantastical sunrise.  An ambrosial summer blend – citrus and vanilla  - is taken to new heights by adding the magical radiance of osmanthus – at once floral and fruity, ethereal and adamantly present. Like its namesake, Perla is absolutely luminous on skin, with a sweetness that beckons rather than overwhelms and a dreamy, enveloping warmth. This makes us smile and we imagine that it will make everyone around us smile, as well. Transportingly pretty."," Lemon, osmanthus, amber, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Royal Muska Eau de Parfum,2573,M. Micallef," Just like in Baudelaire's poem, the sensual aroma of musk in Micallef's Royal Muska,“sings, transporting the soul and sense.” Infused with the creamy sensuality of the indolent flowers of ylang ylang and with the honeyed opulence of roses, the fragrance is exotic and infinitely feminine. The base of benzoin and ripe fruits puts a delicious twist on the composition, giving it a tropical air. This is the scent of tanned skin, of hot days and sultry nights, the heavenly aroma of passionate paradise."," ylang ylang, rose, precious woods, white musks, fruits, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24510.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vanille Oud Eau de Parfum,1012,M. Micallef," As far as we are concerned, there can't be too many great vanilla scents and there certainly can't be too many aouds. Combine the two, and we are smitten. We are addicted to this unique combo of creamy, dreamy vanilla and spicy, resinous aoud. It is a perfect yin and yang harmony. The caramel-like sweetness of vanilla mixed with ylang-ylang and prune softens the starkness of aoud. Oud, in turn, prevents the vanilla accord from being too predictably foodie and infantile. This is a vanilla fragrance for those who usually shy away from vanillas... and a perfect starter scent for those curious about ouds."," bergamot, ylang-ylang, prune, oud, caramel, musk, vanilla, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gaiac Eau de Parfum,1568,M. Micallef," The aroma of gaiac is complex, eluding definition. The precious wood smells balsamic and fresh, sweet and earthy and smoky. Micallef's rendition of gaiac is fittingly complex, inclusive of the many facets of the scent. Bergamot and jasmine infuse the blend with freshness, cloves add spice, vetiver brings out the earthiness of the wood and vanilla sweetens the blend, softening the sharp angles, turning Gaiac into a sensual and tranquil perfume, with a your-skin-but-better base. Perfect for men and women."," bergamot, jasmine, cloves, gaiac, vetiver, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24518.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Homme (Aoud) Eau de Parfum,1840,M. Micallef," Micallef's spicy, honeyed rendition of precious aoud, with its mix of golden saffron and dark-red roses, is sensual and wonderfully exotic. The dry smokiness of the fragrance makes us think of the ritual in Arabia, in which women stand over an oud burner, perfuming their skin and clothes with the unique, enthralling fragrance. Balmily sweet and spicily bitter, Micallef's Aoud is a complex, endlessly intriguing scent. It is said that sandalwood is the fragrance for novices, while aoud is for those“in the know”. Micallef's refined creation is our treat for true connoisseurs."," rose, aoud, sandalwood, cinnamon, saffron, nutmeg, honey, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24519.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Avant Garde Eau de Parfum,1082,M. Micallef," The new masculine offering from Martine Micallef delivers the great promise of its name. The complex composition, built on the contrast of fresh and smoky, dry and almost gourmand, is as unconventional and modern as the name suggests. We love how perfectly the sweet smokiness of tobacco mixed with cocoa balances the striking freshness of the citrusy top notes. The incense and leather blend in the heart of the fragrance is incredibly alluring, a brooding, dark and handsome accord that we find irresistible. The base of tonka bean and amber finishes the development on a softer and wonderfully sensual note. Charismatic blend that feels as contemporary as it is classically elegant."," bergamot, grapefruit, cocoa bean, tobacco, incense, Russian leather, tonka bean, grey amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24520.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Manakara Eau de Parfum,2270,Indult," The second we smelled this, we were positively overcome by its exotic yet approachable beauty. Named for a village in Madagascar known for its legendary lychee fruit (also spelled litchi), it's presented here as a sweet, honeyed and mysterious floral-tinged pudding-like fruit fragrance with amazing hidden depths -- not purple berry fruit, not bright citrus fruit, but rich and delicate lychee, a scent that's like tropical fruits meets ripe red fruits with a soft, creamy floral mixed in. We've never smelled anything quite like it --  ever -- and we had gourmand lovers, fruity fans, floral worshippers and even deep, dangerous fragrance lovers sampling this and positively banging their wrists on the counter demanding to buy it...and we didn't even carry it yet.  A custardy, creamy sweet fruit dessert of a perfume laced with rose water, we can't compare it to anything you've ever tried before and we're quite certain you'll be utterly smitten by this rare beauty. Moist, sweet, rich and delicate...all at the same time."," rose, lychee",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Isvaraya Eau de Parfum,1235,Indult," In India, patchouli is associated with Vishnu, the god savior of mankind and life and the guardian of universal harmony.  Isvaraya means“divine” in Hindi and this perfume is the olfactory fantasy of both modern India and spiritual India, an exotic elixir that blends light patchouli with smooth Indian plum tree and wraps it in jasmine. Although it centers on patchouli, it's not overly earthy. It's rich and unusual, slightly sweet and a tad smoky, a fevered evening spent on multi-hued silken sheets while wisps of incense burn sensually in the corners of your mind. The beautiful starkness of jasmine lights the darkness of patchouli and the deep, spiced fruitiness of the plum tree... utterly unique and completely exotic, Isvaraya is not a fluffy little fragrance you wear without thinking. When you smell Isvaraya, you close your eyes and dream and your spirit is at peace."," Patchouli, Indian plum tree, jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Inspiratrice Eau de Parfum,2122,Divine," L'Inspiratrice, the new offering from the very elegant Divine collection of scents, is a supremely sensual fragrance that displays the refined, classic quality, which we consider to be Divine's trademark in perfume. The dark-red, honeyed warmth of the roses, enhanced by the sweet creaminess of ylang-ylang, vanilla and tonka bean, is combined with the dry and at the same time almost-gourmand earthiness of patchouli and the greenness of vetiver. A delicate sparkle, added to the composition by bergamot and peony, is utterly charming. L'Inspiratrice is bound to please even the most sophisticated of seductresses. Very chic. Truly Divine."," Rose, ylang-ylang, vanilla, tonka bean, vetiver, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
All That Matters Eau de Parfum,1885,Anamor," A subtle and elegant skin scent.  Deceptively simple in composition, All That Matters is one of those fragrances that merges with your skin and reads more like an aura than a perfume. This simplicity works because of the quality of the ingredients. Any musk lover can tell you that not all musk is created equal. The musk at the heart of All That Matters is smooth, with a silken lightness that is almost airy. This particular musk is also very rare and prohibitively expensive – therefore it is infrequently used in commercial fragrances except in tiny amounts. In this handcrafted blend, however, it is the star player -- paired with gorgeous and compelling sandalwood oil from East India and the delicate crispness of lily of the valley. Quiet and compelling. Discreetly seductive."," musk, sandalwood, lily of the valley",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mazzolari Eau de Toilette,2789,Mazzolari," Mazzolari's signature scent is a rich, lush, wood-filled brew guaranteed to cause mass swooning.  It oozes class and beauty, a deeply green, woody fragrance softened by citrus and warmed by sandalwood.  Vetiver and cedar offer majestic backbones to this remarkable brew, and we can't think of anything better than curling up next to someone wearing this, a roaring fire, a glass of cognac and a sky full of stars. Dizzyingly seductive, romantic and deep."," Sandalwood, vetiver, spices and subtle citrus and green notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32807.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lui Eau de Toilette,2299,Mazzolari," Potent and virile, Lui is the fragrance of a refined man with a wild streak a mile wide.  Rich with patchouli, vetiver and leather, this is a complex and unguarded scent, completely comfortable on the skin yet smokin' hot underneath.  Hints of sandalwood tame the wild animal, while a dark amber and rich musk enhance the raw sensuality of Lui.  Raw and elegant at the same time, Lui is an uninhibited fragrance for a man who likes to keep everyone guessing...and just a little on the edge."," Sandalwood, cedar, patchouli, ambergris, vetiver, spices",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32809.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Alessandro Eau de Toilette,2216,Mazzolari," Bitter almond, sweet honey and a soft powdery notes give Alessandro a dreamy, rich quality that zips you away to a bedroom filled with satin sheets, candles and exotic candies.  Almond and honey are the initial temptresses, beguiling your nose with their sweet charms. As the golden almond scent softens, it develops a lovely powdered almond feel...gentle and embracing.  At the base is a vanilla-like warmth with a kiss of sophistication.  Elegant, a bit dry, and utterly captivating, Alessandro is considered by many to be their 'holy grail' of fragrances."," almond, honey, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Musk Eau de Toilette,1446,Mazzolari," Mazzolari's Musk opens with a hint of barely-there spice before giving way to the carefree, light white musk in its heart and soul. As it warms with your skin, it soon reveals its fluffy, sweet nature, wrapping you in a cloud of puffy softness, sweet seduction and delicate guile. A standout among other clean musks, this one lasts forever, softening ever so gently.  It's the perfume equivalent of a soft cashmere sweater. Pure, white and just a touch of mystery."," light musc, subtle spice notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Patchouli Eau de Toilette,1361,Mazzolari," In a word: majestic. Mazzolari's Patchouli is smooth, earthy, deeply sweet and spicy all at once, but with absolutely none of the strident notes sometimes attributed to its main note. Rich, deep amber is woven throughout this masterpiece, which we think should just be labelled“aphrodisiac in a bottle.”  Not for fans of light or breezy scents, Patchouli is a smouldering, exotic animal, and a definite ”˜must-try' for sensualists (men or women) who revel in its dark and oh-so-dangerous depths."," Indonesian patchouli, spices, hints of amber, honey",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'ame Soeur Eau de Parfum,2283,Divine," Named after the most intense and beautiful of encounters, L'Ã¢me SÅ“ur (”œSoulmate”) is an homage to the meeting of kindred spirits.  This fragrance epitomizes a harmony beyond time, an eternal marriage of noble flowers and aldehydes.  Jasmin, otto of Bulgarian rose and ylang from the Comoro Islands are decadent, elegant florals that, when combined with ambergris, form a union of timeless beauty.  Naturally seamless and filled with innate sensuality, L'Ã¢me SÅ“ur is modern example of ancient French perfumery at its most alluring."," jasmine, otto of Bulgarian rose, ylang, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Douceur de Vanille Eau de Parfum,2150,Les Nereides," The softest, milkiest vanilla we've ever found. This evokes the pure, delicate sweetness of the icy crystals on top of homemade ice cream.   Incomparable bourbon vanilla is caressed with almond and cocoa and freshened with white rose. Opening with a burst of innocence and powder, Douceur de Vanille mellows into a gentle, creamy skin scent that seems more like a delectable aura than a perfume – as if you just happen to have naturally delicious skin. The perfect warm weather vanilla. Heavenly."," bourbon vanilla, almond, cocoa, white rose, star aniseed",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Opoponax Eau de Parfum,2747,Les Nereides," Intensely resinous. Deeply sweet. Luxuriously warm. Opoponax smells like a cello sounds. A regal blend of sandalwood, amber, vanilla and, of course, opoponax, this is a profoundly sensuous scent.   You want to let yourself sink into it – to be warmed by the hazy molten gold of late afternoon sun streaming through the window, to feel the glide of heavy satin across bare skin and to let your thoughts drift. Mesmerizing."," opoponax (sweet myrrh), amber, vanilla, sandalwood, benzoin, citrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Patchouli Precieux Eau de Parfum,2786,Les Nereides," The soothing scent of rich, clean earth – unsullied by industry, freshened by rain. This is the loamy soil of an enchanted hillside at dusk as you lay in the grass and watch the clouds turn periwinkle. The opening is very intense, but give it a moment and the trademark gentle touch of Les NÃ©rÃ©ides becomes apparent. The patchouli retains its earthiness, but becomes soft and deep, melding with layers of pillowy vanilla and smooth musk to create a dreamy landscape. Bewitching."," Sweet orange, Green notes, Balsam, Scots Pine, Sandalwood, Patchouli, Vanilla, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11806.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Gardenia Perfume Oil,1972,Michele Bergman," Like floating in and out of a dream. The blossom may be snow-blind white, but there is something deeply mysterious in the soul of gardenia and this silken oil blend captures it. Initially intense, Black Gardenia softens and becomes exquisitely fresh as it warms on your skin.  The beguiling heady sweetness of the beloved flower is rendered with a haunting delicacy and touched with the barest whisper of dark intentions.  Like the lilt of the sirens song or the fragile glow of a will o' the wisp, this fragrance reminds us that something extremely beautiful can also be extremely dangerous.",floral,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Divine Eau de Parfum,1007,Divine," When we heard there was a cult fragrance named Divine, we had our doubts.  It might be very nice, maybe even lovely, but seriously... divine?  That's a bit presumptuous, isn't it?  Then we tried it and all skepticism vanished.  Divine is indeed divine.  We can't think of a better way to describe it.  The first whiff is very strong, very French, very opera and pearls.  Classic and rather formal. As it warms up, it becomes downright swanky-- still sophisticated, but drenched in the glamour of a bygone era:  Black Givenchy dresses, long cigarette holders and serious diamonds. Sipping ice-cold martinis with Frank and Dino on a red leather banquette at the Sands.  And just then, best of all, there is the amazing and complex drydown, balancing soft peach and superbly fresh flowers with a deep base of oak moss, vanilla, musk and spice. Achingly beautiful, impossible to forget. Not a scent for those who prefer their scents girlish and sugary or simple and unobtrusive. This is for confident, complicated women who are prepared to dazzle. Stunning. Breathtaking. And yes, we'll say it one more time-- simply divine."," peach, coriander, gardenia, Indian tuberose, May rose, oak moss, musk, vanilla, spice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Infante Eau de Parfum,2069,Divine," A charming, creamy pink nosegay of sweet peony and ethereal jasmine with a refreshing touch of ivy for greenery. These delicate flowers are cradled in a sensuous base of vanilla, musk and tonka bean and the result is a warm, soft floral with lasting power. Playful, vivacious and sweet, this is a bonbon of a fragrance that's wonderful day or night. Light enough to suit a princess, but with a luxuriousness that befits a future queen. Deliciously pretty."," Chinese jasmine, peony, blackcurrant leaves, ivy, ambergris, vanilla, musk, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Molecule 05 Eau de Toilette,1207,Escentric Molecules," Cashmeran, the sole fragrant component in Molecule 05, has an unusually complex character for a single molecule.

Escentric 05 Eau de Toilette,1728,Escentric Molecules," ""With Escentric 05 I wanted to create a different kind of summer fragrance. Instead of the usual aqueous notes, I was inspired by walking up from the sea on a hot afternoon through dry, aromatic Mediterranean herbs and trees."" -Geza SchoenCashmeran, the molecule at the heart of the 05 series, is dry, radiant, warm and woody with an unexpected touch of pine resin. It's this vibrant quality that caused Geza Schoen to flash back to the Mediterranean, where he spent his childhood summers, and as a result Escentric 05 is truly a different kind of summer scent, infused with vivid, glowing warmth and the contrast of sun-baked plants and trees. Escentric 05 opens with a wonderfully simply top of light, fresh bergamot, and a bright and happy orange note, chosen to represent the orange groves of our hypothetical island destination. Laurel and rosemary carry a signature freshness and spiciness, while a the herbal character of juniper plays against the dry, pungent woodiness of cypress. The drydown features two classic Mediterranean ingredients- cistus labdanum, with its sweet, leathery, balsamic richness, and mastic, a tree-based resin with the clean, sharp scent of newly-cut branches. And they're both layered over the signature 05 Series ingredient, cashmeran- an intoxicating 15% concentration within the formula that provides sensual, woodsy warmth. Far from a typically ""freshie"" summer scent, Escentric 05 captures the emotional warmth of summer memories in a scent with all the signature stylishness of Escentric Molecules."," Fig, bergamot, orange, laurel, rosemary, juniper, basil, hedione, cypress, freesia, iris, jasmine, cashmeran, cistus labdanum, musc, ambroxan, mastic, iso e super",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30859.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Triad Extrait de Parfum,1025,Bortnikoff," Those who adore the scent of oud and long to experience its mysterious aroma in all its glory can scarcely afford to miss out on experiencing the exquisite artistry of Triad.  Utilising his own unique tincture of wild oud from Sri Lanka, perfumer Dmitry Bortnikoff has created a fragrance which will delight and exhilarate long standing lovers of oud and new admirers alike.Triad is a powerful yet refined creation which combines the extraordinary with the familiar. This is a spectacular scent whose skillful composition means that it can be enjoyed by the most experienced connoisseurs and also by those who have never experienced how amazing a real oud based scent can be.The exclusive tincture of wild Sri Lankan oud opens the composition and is underpinned by delicate floral accords of magnolia and rose de mai in the heart of the perfume. Indonesian bouya and organic Chinese oud also make their mysterious presence felt in the core of Triad. At the base, oud from Thailand merges with creamy tonka bean, sweet and sensual benzoin and complex, animalic hyraceum.Whilst using several carefully selected varieties of oud, this perfume offers much more than a simple homage to that magnificently mystical wood. The exquisite floral tones and alluringly sweet and seductive base notes provide a remarkably versatile, if undeniably unique aura which must be experienced and enjoyed throughout many wearings to be truly appreciated."," Tincture of Wild Oud from Sri Lanka, Magnolia, Rose de Mai, Indonesian Bouya, Organic Oud from China (Hay-nan), Oud from Thailand, Tonka Beans, Benzoin from Sumatra, Hyraceum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804016.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Arborist Eau de Parfum,1305,Jorum Studio," Arborist is an ode to enchanting woodlands, the likes of which are found across the brand's native Scotland. Be warned, Arborist is not just lumber. It is an imagined day-in-the-life of a Virideer (the keeper of the grass and green wood in the forest).Arborist possesses an overwhelming and spirited opening mellowing into sun-bleached woods, malted cereals and worked-skin. A symphony of nature untamed. The core structure of Arborist is redolent of many great Scots timbers; their leaves, flowers, fruits, roots and soil being the quintessential portrait of the forest.Arborist presents a unique blend of raw flowers, botanicals, resin sap, underwood and surprising forest fruits. Resolutely sylvan and intriguingly multifaceted with more than a hint of human skin, oily tool and distilling elixirs haunting from afar."," Quince, Honey, Saffron, Osmanthus Absolute, Magnolia, Burdock, Papyrus, Mugwort, Rose Absolute, Tuberose, Myrrh Absolute, Spruce Resin, Douglas Fir, Labdanum, Jatamansi, Malt, Lichen",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/846000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau Capitale Eau de Parfum,1100,Diptyque," When a brand as synonymous with niche fragrance as Diptyque decides to create a scent celebrating the city of Paris,  the possibilities are almost overwhelming. What kind of scent could possibly capture the entirety of the rich,  multi-textured relationship between The City of Lights and the house of Diptyque? But of course,  there actually is a perfect answer- the chypre,  iconic amongst perfume styles,  a legendary accord with a thousand facets. But with the classic chypre so instantly identifiable- bergamot,  rose,  jasmine,  patchouli,  oakmoss- it's incumbent on any re-interpretation to bring something new and unique to the proceedings. Thus,  Eau Capitale is a chypre both respectful of tradition,  and yet uniquely and romantically modern- a dynamic new study of balance and contrast featuring a fresh yet timeless take on the beloved style. It still boats a lively citrus opening,  but with a twist- an especially green ""vert de bergamote"" of pronounced energy,  paired with a burst of pink peppercorn,  unique to the chypre style,  which gives a cool,  sparkling opening of notable modernity. The heart has a classic rose presence,  but utilizing three distinctive expressions of Damascene rose: an essence,  an absolute,  and a concentrate,  for a truly multifaceted and complex floral experience. And finally,  in place of the traditional oakmoss base,  a patchouli ""coeur, "" a fractional extract with a brighter character than traditional patchouli,  which closes us on an invigorating and modern high. Bright,  fresh,  romantic,  and nuanced,  Eau Capitale is a dynamic new chypre that proves that there's still ample life left in the classics- a fitting tribute to Paris if ever there was one."," Bergamot, pink pepper, rose essence, rose absolute, rose concentrate, patchouli coeur",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fougere L'Aube Eau de Toilette,1525,Rogue Perfumery," Boy, Manuel Cross wasn't messing around when he made FougÃ¨re L'Aube. Modelled after the first fougÃ¨re ever to be made, the original FougÃ¨re Royale by Houbigant, FougÃ¨re L'Aube heralds a triumphant return to the unapologetically masculine roots of the fougÃ¨re concept – the fresh, bitter aroma created by the marriage of lavender, oakmoss, and labdanum, given aromatic interest by way of minty geranium leaf and the sting of camphor.FougÃ¨re L'Aube is much more than a simple re-tread using great raw materials and real oakmoss, however. True to its name – which means ”˜fougÃ¨re of the dawn' – this scent opens with a burst of sparkling lemon and lavender, for a sunny ”˜garrigue' effect that's much brighter than the traditional fougÃ¨re opening led by bergamot. The bitter green galbanum and dry hay soon move in to darken the foresty shadows, though, and with the cool rosy-minty sting of geranium in the background, the oft-cited reference to the scent of ferns (fougÃ¨re meaning ”˜fern' in French) for once makes perfect sense. This is really old school, masculine canon – strictly for lovers of classic fougÃ¨res like Azzaro Pour Homme, Brut, and crisp green scents such as Green Irish Tweed."," lavender, oakmoss, geranium, citrus, hay, galbanum, costus, musk, sandalwood, camphor, amber, Moroccan rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Medie Eau de Parfum,1737,Cire Trudon," MÃ©die is a symphony of citrus: the perfume's roots evoke the Antiquity and the kingdom of Alexander the Great, under which the province of MÃ©die abounded with rare citruses. An oasis of freshness, MÃ©die encapsulates the very heart of the fruit where citrus, spices and aromatic notes blend. In addition, bright green scents are combined with clear amber and woody notes, warmed up by a touch of incense. Composed like a citrus fragrance with an aromatic finish, MÃ©die leaves a vibrant bitterness in the air."," Grapefruit, Green mandarin, Sambac jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/559081.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Borneo Oud Pure Oud Oil,1489,Fragrance du Bois," While superior quality oud shines through in any blend of ingredients,  a truly extraordinary specimen is like a single-malt or an outstanding varietal in that it really ought to be experienced on its own. Borneo Oud is a pure oud oil,  organically and sustainably sourced from Southeast Asia and aged over 4 years,  distilled into a sprayable oil that showcases the depth and sophistication of this rarified oud- spicy and rich,  yet vibrant and green. It's substantial enough to wear beautifully on its own,  but also the perfect oud to layer,  with a versatile drydown that balances animalic warmth and invigorating freshness. A true example of Fragrance du Bois' brand ethos of ""luxury with a conscience, "" this exquisite,  sustainably organic oud is a must have for all oud aficionados.", 100% pure oud,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chypre Azural Eau de Parfum,2390,Les Indemodables," If you've long thought of the chypre category as dark and mysterious, think again. Chypre Azural is as juicy and fresh as the Sicilian Tarocco orange at its heart. Typically a contrast between fresh top notes and a mossy accord, that characteristic contrast can go in many directions, and in Chypre Azural it tips toward aromatic and bright, with patchouli grounding it in that family.An intriguing tarragon note snakes its aromatic way around a subdued rose and prominent orange, drying down to a skin scent with substance thanks to an authentic ambergris tincture, which adds body, roundness, and a touch of shadow to its sunny nature. Unlike many citrus-forward scents that seem to disappear as soon as you spray them on, Chypre Azural sticks around, swirling and evolving on skin until it and you become one."," Sicilian Tarocco orange oil, Egyptian centifolia rose absolute grand cru, Indonesian patchouli, Ambergris tincture, Tarragon from the Alps",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Eau des Sacres,1599,Reims Parfums," L'Eau des Sacres executes its leap between its cool-toned, aromatic opening and its warm, golden drydown so effortlessly that it feels like watching the prima ballerina at the Paris Opera performing a piquÃ© turn for you alone. Opening in a cloud of peppery violet-and-lavender brightness, the scent feels ethereal yet unpretentious, like wandering into a small, rustic French church at Easter and inhaling the scent of flowers and herbs being placed over nubbins of waxy, lemony frankincense. Wafts of honeyed orange blossom add to the spring-like delicacy and brightness.It's in the basenotes that things take a seriously sensual tone. Dropping the aromatic herbs and petals of its opening, the scent dips us backwards into a warm bath of buttery, almond-inflected tonka bean, bolstered with a gorgeous ”˜buerre noisette' sandalwood. Lovers of Tonka ImpÃ©riale will rejoice in this drydown – similarly warm and comforting as the Guerlain, L'Eau des Sacres is perhaps even more natural-smelling and durable. A touch of ambergris adds an agreeably salty-fresh bitterness that keeps the sweetness in check. We think that that L'Eau des Sacres' ”˜a little from column A, a little from column B' approach creates the perfect all-season bridge between the freshness of aromatic spring florals and the buttery winter weight of tonka-fied amber."," Pink pepper, lavender, orange blossom, honey, rose, tonka bean, sandalwood, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Awake Eau de Parfum,1945,Akro," The opening jolts you awake, like a loved one passing a freshly brewed espresso in front of your nose as you begin to nod off. Hot, black, intense roasted bean with the burnt edge of wood crackling in the grate. The green bite of cardamom giving it a tart edge. Awake's darkness is tantalizingly profound, but the perfumer has thoughtfully slipped a nugget of toasted hazelnut in with the coffee to buffer it from any sharpness or acridity. Awake manages that compromise between sharp and sweet so smoothly that you begin to imagine it's easy – but make no mistake, it is the experienced hand of Cresp that keeps the scent on an even keel. The dance of coffee, hazelnut, and toasted wood ebbs and flows through the scent like a steady pulse, before sweetening slightly, finishing out in a remarkably textured rendition of those crunchy coffee candies in the checkout aisle of Italian grocery stores. Not sweet, not particularly gourmand, and yet, also not bitter or grainy in that way that coffee scents can be, Awake is the happy medium of coffee scents."," Balkans Santos Coffee, Green Cardamom, Italian Lemon, Haitian Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
B683 Eau de Parfum,1077,Marc-Antoine Barrois,"“I like the raw and yet so chic aspect of this perfume: a very refined and wild fragrance.” – Quentin Bisch, perfumerB683 is a result of the meeting of two young designers. One is a couturier, the other a perfumer. Their childhood memories brought them together. Remembering captivating smells; of the leather from an elegant attachÃ© case or an immaculate desk blotter; of the distinct smells of wood during the regular gathering of fuel to warm the family home. The artistic skills of the former and the olfactory talent of the latter together sparked a magical and pleasant fragrance with its notes of spices, leather and wood. What We Think An oh-so-wearable leather scent that feels smoothly sophisticated but dynamically modern- the spice and woods add tone and energy without sacrificing elegance."," Black Pepper, Saffron, Chili Pepper, Nutmeg, Violet Leaf, Amber, Cistus Absolute, Musk, Patchouli, Santal Wood, Oakmoss, Ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/822000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ramune (Japanese Soda) Eau de Parfum,2303,J-Scent," The nostalgic scent reminds you of the excitement when you pop open a ramune bottle sealed with a marble stopper at a summer festival.The refreshing scent of ramune that cools your body on a hot summer night. This perfume starts with the clear notes of lemon, aldehyde and mint, then brings the gentle sweet notes of rose, lily of the valley and magnolia, eventually leaving behind the notes of musk and vanilla, relaxing the senses. This scent will evoke summer memories, lighting your heart with nostalgic dreamy summer lanterns. What We Think The distinctly bubblegummy flavor of Ramune comes through with evocative clarity- minty, fruity, fresh, and fun."," Spearmint, Peppermint, Lemont Squash, Raspberry, Bergamot, Aldehyde, Rose, Muguet, Water Lily, Magnolia, Hyacinth, Musk, Amber, Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/814006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fille en Aiguilles Eau de Parfum,2463,Serge Lutens," The name means“Girls in Needles” – and pine needles at that, rather than chic“talons aiguilles” (stiletto heels)... But boys can roll around in them too: this is a decidedly non-gendered, atmospheric scent.Pine essence is a risky bet in perfumery: its medicinal, turpentine fumes conjure household disinfectants or cough drops and are particularly hard to tame. Serge Lutens, never one to shirk a challenge, opted for playing them up rather than tamping them down: the result is uncharacteristically raw, almost minimalist. In Filles en Aiguilles, the powerful resinous smell of pine is compounded by the camphor blast of vetiver and a wisp of gunpowder incense. Fruity fir balsam and the trademark Lutens candied fruit notes sweeten the blend without playing down its dark green radiance. A searing afternoon in Mediterranean pine groves or a Californian forest; a Buddhist temple or Christmas morning; the hale aroma of a lumber yard; a painter's studio strewn with turpentine-soaked rags...  Whatever memories Filles en Aiguilles conjures, this poignantly evocative, meditative potion will somehow feel healing. You'll need it this winter. What We Think The sweet aromatic freshness of pine sap and candied fruit makes this a joyfully nostalgic autumn fragrance."," Pine needles, vetiver, sugary sap, laurel, fir balsam, frankincense, candied fruit and spice.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36132.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Purple Haze Eau de Parfum,2134,19-69," ""The fragrance Purple Haze embraces the hippie movement and counterculture just like John and Yoko's bed-ins in Amsterdam and Montreal. Purple Haze is about the legendary Keenak who I met in Bahama Village, Key West. Guitar on his back, snakeskin boots, skinny jeans, and long hair. A sense of Woodstock. It is a tribute to creativity, freedom, and indulgence."" -Johan Bergelin Since when did we all get so scared of smelling like a hippie? Unlike many of its patchouli-based contemporaries in niche fragrance, Purple Haze doesn't run away from the raw, earthy, evocative power of this misunderstood material. Instead, it delivers the wearer a heady, intoxicating, psychedelic fougere that mixes intensely fresh aromatic notes like cypress, cannabis, and thyme with a rich patchouli-woods-vanilla base for an extremely groovy trip back in time. Deep, powerful, quirky and captivating, Purple Haze is a scent unafraid to embrace its inner love child."," Italian Bergamot, Corsican Cypress, Cannabis Accord, Ranesara, Ciste, Palmarosa, Thyme, Gurjum, Violet Leaf, Vanilla, Patchouli, Black Pepper, White Musk, Dry Woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Peau de Peche Eau de Parfum,2321,Keiko Mecheri," This begins with a lovely, delicate and true white peach. Not a peach drenched in syrup or baked in a pie, but newly picked from the tree, with that fragile, unforgettable scent of fresh peach skin. An elegant peach, wrapped in a mist of soft sandalwood and powdery orris. Peau de Peche has an elusive quality, like chasing a will-o'-the-wisp than leads you ever further into an enchanted forest.

Lost Cherry Eau de Parfum,1882,TOM FORD Private Blend," Lost Cherry is a contrasting scent that reveals a tempting dichotomy of playful, candy-like gleam on the outside and luscious flesh on the inside. Innocence intersects indulgence with an opening the captures the classic perfection of the exotic cherry fruit. Black cherry's ripe flesh dripping in cherry liqueur glistens with a teasing touch of bitter almond. The heart bursts forth in cherry waves of sweet and tart. Griotte syrup expresses the textured maceration of voluptuous fruits while breathtaking florals of Turkish rose and jasmine sambac penetrate the senses and soul. Peru balsam and roasted tonka at the drydown suggest a new portrait of an iconic symbol. When blended with an unexpected mÃ©lange of sandalwood, vetiver and cedar, the finish reaches fantasy-inspiring levels of insatiability. What We Think A sweet, boozy-rich cherry with a smooth tonka drydown- a grown-up almond gourmand scent with a sexy edge."," black cherry accord, bitter almond, griotte syrup, rose absolute OrpurÂ®, Peru balsam, roasted tonka Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Lost Cherry by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Over the Chocolate Shop Eau de Parfum,2939,4160 Tuesdays," Once upon a time, 4160 Tuesdays magic-maker Sarah McCartney was inspired to create a chocolate scent by her friend's apartment, which was serendipitously perched atop a chocolate shop. The scent was everything a chocolate shop scent should be- rich, creamy, and delectable- but this was before Sarah had learned the ins and outs of perfume production, so the recipe went back in a drawer. Years later, it has been resurrected, and we're all the richer for it. Simply put, if you've been searching for the scent of real chocolate- not cookies, not cake, but a pure, decadent chocolate truffle- Over the Chocolate Shop may just be your holy grail. Every simple, mouthwatering ingredient- sumptuous cocoa butter, creamy vanilla, caramelized praline, a perfect sprinkle of coffee- blends seamlessly into a divine confection, a picture-perfect bonbon plucked from the window of a fairytale chocolatier, a single bite you'll remember for the rest of your life. Those of us who truly love chocolate scents are always on the hunt for the next great one. We're pleased to announce that it's arrived."," Praline, cocoa butter, coffee, hazelnut, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64625.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eleventh Hour Eau de Parfum,1333,BYREDO," It seems funny to say this, but Eleventh Hour is not the first fragrance we've carried based on the end of the world. It is, however, still quite a novelty- the first fragrance ever to feature an astonishing new note- Ban Timmur, a Nepalese plant related to Szechwan pepper, known for both intense, almost anesthetic spice but also unusually bright, citrussy tones. Don't worry if it's hard to imagine- the utterly unique note is the very first thing you'll smell on your initial spray, a combination of juicy citrus and sweet, spicy, clovelike tones for a note both thrillingly novel, but also possessed of a certain familiar holiday-spice styled comfort. The heart it leads into is every bit as original- spicy, earthy carrot seed set against sweetly seductive rum and juicy, wild fig. Warm, smooth tonka dominates the drydown, but the real wonder of 11th Hour is the pervasiveness of the Ban Timmur, lending the fragrance the sweet, rich spiciness of an opulent oriental scent, but with a distinctively fresh energy that lasts into the drydown. According to Byredo, featuring an ingredient from the imposing Nepalese highlands is a statement on the kind of inhospitable places humanity may eventually be forced to survive as ocean levels rise. Heavier stuff than a perfume description can necessarily grapple with, to be sure, but at least now we know that when the end of the world arrives, we're going to be smelling great, really, really, great."," Ban timmur pepper, bergamot, carrot seed, rum, wild fig, tonka bean, cashmere woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sabbia Bianca Eau de Parfum,2517,Profumum," Concentrated at a whopping 43% of pure perfume oil and playing host to some of the world's most exquisite natural floral absolutes, Sabbia Bianca is the Rolls Royce of the Big White Floral genre. The composition is uncluttered, with only four listed notes. That's because when you go to the trouble of sourcing the best and most expensive tuberose, ylang, and tiare, you want their beauty to be able to shine uninterrupted. Sabbia Bianca is the perfect fantasy of a tropical island in a bottle, complete with sugar-white sand, crystalline azure waters, and gently-swaying palm trees. Immediately upon application, you are plunged into a pool of lush, inviting coconut milk, its surface dotted with waxy tiare petals. The buttery tuberose and gardenia are huge, and so heavily narcotic that you feel as if you've sipped on moonshine made from tropical flowers. Although Sabbia Bianca is almost obscenely rich, flickers of a woody freshness here and there hold the perfume back from excessive sweetness - perhaps the banana leaf nuance in the ylang or the greenness of the violet. That said, keep in mind that just one drop of this super concentrated elixir is enough to radiate heady tropical warmth all day long. Our take on Sabbia Bianca is this: sometimes you have to go all out to experience perfection in a genre. And for us, Sabbia Bianca is worth the investment."," tuberose, violet, ylang ylang, tiare",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33948.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sundrunk Eau de Parfum,2600,Imaginary Authors," ""Woozy and warm from the sun, we shared an orange pop and watched the surfers' last lines of the day.""Amy ObisboBlindingly bright, captivatingly crisp, Sundrunk explodes onto the palate with electric notes of citrus spiked with a vibrantly herbaceous sheen. It's the rich, dizzy, warm-to-your-fingertips feeling of an afternoon running with friends in the blinding brightness, sharing toasts to life and youth and creativity, and collapsing in a tired, satisfied heap as the afternoon crawls by. With a delicious, thirst-quenching combination of shimmering orange, smooth florals and tantalizingly tart rhubarb, one sniff is enough to soothe, energize, and delight, all at once. Sundrunk's extraordinary freshness may not last forever- but when you're under its spell, it sure feels like it will."," Neroli, rhubarb, honeysuckle, rose water, orange zest, first kiss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77515.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Time Eau de Parfum,1255,The House Of Oud," What a beautiful, refreshing tea scent! Fans of tea scents know that a good one is difficult to find; well, House of Oud's The Time is a good one. The opening of bergamot, chamomile, and wormwood note creates a superb green tea impression, uniquely fresh and bitter, but with a nutty hay-like undertone. Slowly, other types of tea notes start to feed into the scent, helping to round out the picture and fill in the gaps. Oolong tea adds a milkiness that softens the astringency of the green tea, rendering it cloudy, while a black tea note lends a smoky leathery nuance. Together, the combination of the different teas gives the scent a subtle“roasted” undertone.   There's a series of contrasts at play here that works very well. The Time smells both fresh and comforting, milky and smoky, which all adds up to a sort of green-on-cream effect. The nubuck suede notes in the base tie it all together for an experience that feels like drinking a cup of green tea in an upmarket equestrian store, surrounded by the complex aromas of saddle leather, tea leaves, and even the polite suggestion of hay. We're confident that fans of refined leather-tea fragrances such as Memo's Eau de Memo and Hermes' Osmanthe Yunnan will find a new love in The Time."," Bergamot, wormwood, chamomile, oolong tea, iris, lemon verbena, cedar, musk, amber, black tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76422.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vanilla Cake Eau de Parfum,1568,Montale," Could there ever be an aroma more blissful than removing a freshly-baked cake from the oven? The feeling of accomplishment for a job well done, the mouthwatering, sweet, warm smell that fills the room, the anticipation of that perfect first bite- it's heaven on earth. With Vanilla Cake, Montale invites you to enjoy that wondrous feeling every single day. This gourmand and bewitching fragrance recipe calls for blending milk, grilled almonds, warm caramel and vanilla for the ultimate meringue silllage. Creamy, sweet, toasty and rich, this is a perfect gourmand scent, the kind to leave a trail of admirers salivating. Utterly delicious."," Almond powder, butter cream, milky mousse, caramel, yogurt cake, meringue, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Freeway Eau de Parfum,1881,4160 Tuesdays," Freeway is the story that jumped, fully formed, into Sarah McCartney's mind when she visited Scent Bar one hot summer's day and stepped out onto the hot asphalt outside. A friend was just driving away, and the smell of his Maserati's exhaust mixed with the scent of the orange blossom in the air and the tang of hot, melting asphalt...Sarah was inspired then and there to create an urban take on orange blossom exclusively for Luckyscent, to help celebrate our 15th anniversary. The idea was to take the fresh, sugary brightness of orange blossom and sully it with a host of gritty, determinedly non-floral smells from an urban environment, making for a scent with a sexy kick in its tail: think flowers crushed under a rubber-soled sneaker. Sarah uses mandarin petigrain oil here for its plummy citrus aroma but also for its fuel-like facet; the result is sweet orange blossom water spilled on hot tar. For such a popular note, orange blossom is easy to get wrong – too sweet and it's juvenile, too honeyed and it can turn sleazy. Freeway does orange blossom right, pitched exactly halfway between bright and dark. Dry woods, tobacco, and grassy cannabis notes dry out the tarry orange blossom until it smells more like old paper and less like a flower. A light, foamy vanilla froths around the dry, papery notes for a result that smells like eating a thimbleful of insanely rich, perfumery orange blossom gelato in an antique book store. Urban and urbane, Freeway is the scent of L.A.'s future, when, as Sarah says,“all cars are solar powered and the Freeways have cycle lanes, orange groves, jasmine hedgerows, and picnic areas.”"," Mandarin petitgrain, orange blossom, tobacco, rum, brandy, cannabis, woods, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64623.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
20 Mars 2022 Eau de Parfum,1834,Rundholz Parfums," What does the future smell like? Obviously, we'll have to wait to know for sure, but with 20MARS2022, Rundholz for the first time explores the scent of a date not yet reached- and they're reaching for the stars. Opening with an intensely peppery explosion quickly warmed with a bouquet of refined gourmand spice, delicately sweetened with a touch of fruit and a rich, but restrained floral heart. The true star, as with all Rundholz scents, is the deep, balsamic incense that emerges in the heart, rich and resinous, made lightly smoky with a touch of crÃ¨me brulee vanilla and haylike Tonka bean, given a sensual animalic growl with civet and castoreum.  Overall, the effect is enveloping, the kind of deep, wondrous incense scent where each sniff reveals a new facet. Sure, we know the ""Mars"" in 20Mars2022 refers to the month, and not the planet. But with a scent this out of this world, you'll have to forgive us for not always remembering that."," Pink pepper, black pepper, saffron, lovage, cinnamon, strawberry, jasmine, lily of the valley, rose, frankincense, patchouli, vetiver, sandalwood, cedarwood, nagarmotha, hay, vanilla, Tonka bean, labdanum, musk, civet, ambergris, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Une Amourette Roland Mouret Eau de Parfum,2399,Etat Libre d'Orange," ""An unforgettable love affair, "" Une Amourette is the result of a portentious conversation between Etat Libre d'Orange and groundbreaking fashion designer Roland Mouret. Every bit as iconoclastic in the world of design as ELDO is for French fragrance,  Mouret's work demonstrate a preternatural eye for sensuality,  flow and innovation,  a gift for draping fabric over skin in the same way that Etienne de Swardt's fragrances drape the skin. So,  of course,  a collaboration was inevitable- but what a collaboration this is. Soft and romantic,  yet striking and avant-garde,  Une Amourette is a beautifully woodsy iris that wears like the most flattering couture you can imagine. It starts with the iris note- sharp but not stark,  with just the right amount of floral lushness to allow the vanilla-tinged akigala wood to slowly develop underneath,  adding a purringly seductive,  subtly muscular form to the flowing silhouette of the scent. As it dries,  the gentle earthiness of the iris further gives shape to the body beneath,  evoking a softer-but still distinctive- carnality that has us positively swooning. Some partnerships are so obvious you wonder why they've taken so long to manifest,  but in the case of Une Amourette,  we think we know the answer- they wanted to keep us waiting."," Iris, akigala wood, vanilla, jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47750.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Le Cri De La Lumiere Eau de Parfum,1195,Parfum d'Empire," Inspired by the light towards which all beings reach out whether entering or leaving this world, Le Cri de la LumiÃ¨re employs a sparse framework of just three notes: ambrette, iris, and rose. But for all its elegant minimalism, this is a scent with plenty to say. Ambrette, with its tart nuances of green apple, pear, and grappa, is first to announce its presence, bathing the scent in a halo of crystalline light. The opening pitches high, with an almost citrusy sparkle. The iris note, at first rooty and then bready, moves in to flesh out the structure, like a length of suede draped over a metal chair. Comparisons between this perfume and another ambrette-iris composition, Chanel No. 18, are natural – but Le Cri de la LumiÃ¨re is far brighter and drier affair, with a delicate sourness absent from the Chanel. As silvery as a glass of white vermouth, the scent gains a blush in its cheeks thanks to the late addition of rose. The ambrette wraps around the rose and iris, bedding them down in a soapy muskiness that feels both clean and sensual. The texture of this scent is dappled; in turns sheer and cloudy, bright and shaded, like a glass of Pastis into which a drop of water has just been stirred. Le Cri de la LumiÃ¨re is a fragrance with noble lineage: aristocratic, haughty, and a little mysterious."," Ambrette, rose, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35718.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Wulong Cha Extrait de Parfum,2790,Nishane," Wulong ChÃ¡ is a vibrant, woody fig tea with a refreshing twist of citrus to give it sparkle. It opens with an Earl Grey type of freshness, with black tea leaves oily with bergamot, orange, and an exotic, fruity lift that is not immediately identifiable (that would be the litchi). But the heart is pure Oolong: a smoky tea full of delicate, nutty roasted flavors, and a slight but noticeable milkiness. The introduction of the fig note in the heart adds to this impression of milkiness; it smells beautifully like a freshly snapped fig leaf, green and oozing with fig sap.What a lovely balance of tannins, fruit, and milk this is. We like Wulong ChÃ¡ because it has both the clean, fresh transparency we've come to expect from great tea fragrances, but also a sweet, figgy milkiness that rounds off any sharp corners. In the later stages, a gauzy white musk, as soft as a pillow and spiced gently with nutmeg, wraps everything up in a light, silky embrace. Wulong ChÃ¡ is a refreshing wear, especially in summer, but it's also insanely soothing. Strictly to be worn with a white linen shirt and a mint julep in hand."," Bergamot, orange, lychee, mandarin, oolong tea, nutmeg, musk, fig",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77417.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lily Eau de Toilette,2580,Comme des Garcons: Olfactory Library," Lily of the valley takes a trip to the land of green (and likes it!). An absolutely gorgeous combination of the much-loved lily and freesia flowers, together with the extremely smooth notes of green syringe (lilac leaves) and dog rose buds, Lily is never drowned in grassy or herbaceous green. Instead, the subtle leaf notes merely round out the fragrance, imparting a fresh (and definitely tart) crispness to the languid florals. Stimulating and alive, Lily will make you throw your preconceived notions of what a floral fragrance is out the door. A must-try for both floral and non-floral lovers!"," Lily of the valley, freesia, green syringa, dog rose buds",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77202.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Guimauve de Noel Eau de Parfum,1826,Parle Moi de Parfum," Selected by Denyse Beaulieu to feature in her top 10 of 2016 for Grain de Musc, Guimauve de NÃ¶el is a pillowy marshmallow scent flavored with orange flower water and dusted in enough powdered sugar to make your teeth ache. But while it reminds us most pleasurably of fougassette, a type of bread fragrant with orange flower water sold in every market in Provence, this is not at all a heavy, gluttonous fragrance. Rather, it is a tender puff of orange flower-scented air with the sparkle of sugar crystals. It has a very French character, reminiscent both of those little chouquettes eaten by French schoolchildren at snack time, as well as the milky vapors of their evening baths, orange flower water sprinkled liberally into the water by Maman. Guimauve de NÃ¶el is a frothy, tender delight that is just perfect for celebrating the innocence of youth and the joy of family life. If you are a lover of By Kilian's Love or Eau Aimable by Le Couvent des Minimes, then you will adore Guimauve de NÃ¶el."," Orange blossom, vanilla, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Roaring Radcliff Eau de Parfum,1592,Penhaligons," Scandalous,  rebellious and sexy,  Roaring Radcliff bursts into the world of Penhaligon's Portraits as the secret love-child of staid (on the surface) Lord George and his wild,  seductive mistress,  Clandestine Clara. ""Unburdened by title or propriety, "" as he is described,  Radcliff is a hard-partying,  fast-driving,  ever-libidinous rogue,  and his namesake fragrance packs an appropriate growl of rum-drenched,  deeply smoky tobacco,  given a touch of his illicit high society lineage with a deep streak of sweet,  spicy,  mouthwatering gingerbread. Radcliff is a rebel,  all right,  but not the kind to start a fight- more like the kind to sweet-talk you into the night of your life.... consequences be damned."," Rum, Tobacco, Ginger Bread",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441020.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Winter passes and one remembers one's perseverance. – Yoko Ono, artistHauntingly evocative, tantalizingly nostalgic, Willows is a cool, ethereal scent that stands out without ever raising its voice. Crisp white pepper provides a delicate pulse, while powdery orris and violet soothe against a lightly sweet, gently spicy melange of carrot seed and smooth, compelling rye. A uniquely dignified scent."," White pepper, carrot seed, mimosa, orris root butter, rye, violet, tonka bean absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65111.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Baraonda Extrait de Parfum,2103,Nasomatto," A mysterious addition to the Nasomatto line, Baraonda comes with few clues attached. The name means“chaos” or“uproar” in Italian, but the fragrance itself is subtle and almost transparent. The nose of this fragrance warns us that it will evoke“a raw taste sensation”....but what we taste is both comforting and refined. Baraonda smells like the pleasures of fall, painted with a light hand. A tumbler of whiskey held up to catch the glow from an open fire. Delicate little glass bowls holding red berries, quince, and apples baked slowly until they fall apart. An old book, open on the lap, filling the air with the dry, papery scent of lignin. A hint of caramelized wood resin dancing around the edges of the room but never closing in. Baraonda takes the heavy oil paints of the boozy-gourmand genre and uses them to make a watercolor so exquisite that it will have you savoring its taste on your tongue long after you've worn it.","red berries, quince, apples, wood resin, whiskey, ",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Don't Cry For Me Eau de Parfum,1519,ALTAIA," A glitteringly sweet portrait of the idealized Buenos Aires of a bygone era, Don't Cry For Me is as intoxicating as a warm summer evening singing with the citywide bloom of jasmine blossoms. The white floral notes are rich but weightless, floating by as if on the warm ambered breeze, while delicate tea and woods notes sing with nostalgic authenticity.

Vetiver Moloko Eau de Parfum,1991,Ex Nihilo," To the initiated, Moloko, the futuristic cocktail in A Clockwork Orange, conjures all sorts of associations: futuristic mod fashion, milky whiteness, and a dangerous, intoxicating vitality. With Vetiver Moloko, Ex Nihilo capitalizes on that imagery, delivering a fragrance on the one hand earthy and spiky, on the other soft and milky, which combine for an addictive, slightly unnerving symphony of scents that evolve on the skin with fascinating effect.Vetiver Moloko opens with bright, lightly bitter bergamot and soft rose notes, revealing its dual nature straight from the beginning. In the heart, the tantalizing milk accord blurs the olfactory picture for a narcotizing effect, while woodsy cypress buzzes along the surface. Once the vetiver reveals itself, we realize just how potent this cocktail has been all along, while a drop of vanilla at the end re-balances. Whether you're out with the droogs or on the prowl for a chelloveck or devotchka, Vetiver Moloko is not to be missed."," Bergamot, Bulgarian rose, cypress, milk accord, vetiver, amyris, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fleur Narcotique Eau de Parfum,1483,Ex Nihilo," While the Left Bank gets all the traditional credit for being Paris' arts and cultural center,  everyone knows that it's the Rive Droite,  with its bustle,  style and know-how,  where the new generation is coming to life. Fleur Narcotique,  an airy,  vibrantly juicy floral designed as Ex Nihilo's ""interpretation of the new Rive Droite woman, "" is both sophisticated and seductive,  indicative of the 21st century Paris,  where tradition and modernity walk thrillingly hand in hand. Fleur Narcotique opens with a vital and fruit-laden set of top notes,  with bright,  energetic bergamot embracing a burst of juicy peach and exotic,  fruity lychee. In the heart,  the rich lusciousness of jasmine meets the fresh beauty of peony,  with light,  white orange blossom lending texture and depth. As Fleur Narcotique dries,  a rich but transparent base of wood,  musk and moss keeps the dreamily narcotic effect alive for hours,  keeping you sniffing again and again. The modern Rive Droite woman is a complex and sophisticated blend of substance and panache.

JF begins with an invigorating burst of bergamot, lemon, lime and mandarin in combination with an intensely aromatic blend with armoise, coriander and clary sage. Juniper berry, cypress and petitgrain at the heart give the fragrance its unmistakeable masculine character which is underscored by amber, cedarwood and a mossy, musky base."," Bergamot, coriander, green, herbal, lemon, lime, mandarin, cypress, juniper, petitgrain, amber, cedarwood, moss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71510.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Marrakech Intense Eau de Toilette,2775,Aesop," Marrakech Intense is a woody oriental blend balanced by fresh floral top and heart notes, with a hint of the animalistic.

Moon Bloom Eau de Parfum,2036,Hiram Green Perfumes," Lush and elegant,  Moon Bloom is not just another tuberose fragrance - it's the gorgeous,  completely natural tuberose that makes us wonder why any fragrance wouldn't be. Demonstrating a complete mastery of natural materials,  Hiram Green has created a fragrance that captures all aspects of the flower known as the“mistress of the night, ” soft and creamy,  but also powerfully narcotic. Sparing no expense,  Green uses plentiful amounts of tuberose absolute,  blending it with a full-bodied,  lightly indolic jasmine absolute and a lusciously tropical ylang ylang. Notes of coconut and leafy greens give body and contrast,  while hints of tropical spices and resins up the spicy,  sexy factor without ever sacrificing the fragrance's raw beauty. No matter the ingredients,  Moon Bloom would be a wonderfully realized tropical tuberose.

Relique d'Amour Eau de Parfum,1317,Oriza L. Legrand," The smell of an old chapel in a Cistercian abbey. Cold stone walls covered with damp moss. Waxed wood of altar and old pews ornate with carvings. Linseed oil in lamps. Incense and myrrh discernible in the air. But how fresh and spicy the smell of white royal lilies on this background! Relique d'Amour is a subtle floral scent with green accents of leaves and powdery touches of yellow pollen. The beam of light breaks through the stained glass and illuminates this olfactory tumult of feelings varying from exaltation to humility and back. The silence creates a sense of the divine call.Bottle comes as a splash with an atomizer spray included in the box."," Fresh Herbs, pine, powdery notes, white lily, pepper, oak, incense, myrrh, elemi, musk, moss, waxed wood, woody notes, pepper.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65219.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Palermo Eau de Parfum,2417,BYREDO," In the ancient Mediterranean city of Palermo, the regional capital of Sicily, the orange trees that Berber and Moorish emirs planted long ago still grow. Their bergamot and bigarade fruits light up Byredo's Palermo, a scent as close to olfactory happiness as you can get, a perfume played in the highest, brightest keys.Palermo's citrus grove sits alongside a rose garden, its rose bushes greened up in spring with the smell of crushed orange tree leaves and sliced fruits: lemon, lime, grapefruit, and maybe even aromatic pomelo. In its opening, an effervescent freshness of citrus juice is layered with cut citrus rinds, their zest oils conveying a more intense richness, bitterness, and spice.During your walk in the garden, as the sun warms your skin, a warm musk rises up, slightly powdery, softening the bracing freshness of the hesperidic top notes of Palermo and helping the freshness to linger with the warmth. This is a unisex fragrance perfect for warmer months."," Sicilian bergamot, bigarade, fresh rose absolute, skin musk, ambrette flower",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sorriso Eau de Parfum,1812,Profumum," A delicious and sophisticated gourmand scent built on the always-enticing combination of chocolate and orange. The bitter orange opening is bright and sharp and does not fade away, but melds beautifully with the intense and luscious chocolate note that dominates the blend.  The notes list bitter chocolate, but it does not have the aggressive bite of unsweetened baker's squares. Instead it reminds us of fine, European bittersweet cocoa powder – like Valrhona or Callebaut – rich and dark, with just a hint of sweetness. Dusted over fresh orange and velvety woods (and perhaps a creamy vanilla-tinged note, as well), this is a luxurious, grown-up cocoa with no marshmallows in sight. Sorriso is one of the most elegant chocolate scents we have ever encountered. It isn't sugary or buttery and it doesn't juxtapose the edible elements with surprising, jarring notes. It is smooth and balanced, earning its sophistication by embracing the bitter elements of chocolate, as well as the sweet, and by using soft, soothing wood as an anchor. Sorriso means smile and this fragrance will surely evoke many of them."," Bitter chocolate, bitter orange, exotic woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33938.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tam Dao - Eau de Parfum,1877,Diptyque," A familiar yet reinvented interpretation, with accentuated, enhanced major notes... the Eau de Parfum expresses itself with even more personality, audacity, intensity and tenacity. Here, with Tam Dao, the star ingredient, sandalwood from Mysore, is of exceptional quality. In the EDP version, Ginger, Tahiti lime, and the coconut accord emphasize the creamy smooth facet of Mysore sandalwood, resulting in a milky, woody creamy concoction."," Lime, Coriander, ginger, sandalwood, cedarwood, musc, vanilla, amber wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483140.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau Duelle - Eau de Parfum,1888,Diptyque," A familiar yet reinvented interpretation, with accentuated, enhanced major notes... the Eau de Parfum expresses itself with even more personality, audacity, intensity and tenacity. Here, the star ingredient, Vanilla bourbon from Madagascar, is a richer, deeper interpretation of bourbon vanilla married with a vanilla pod infusion. And to top it all off, the intensity is made more powerful with incense and amber, resulting in a sensual, rounded vanilla with animalic and leather facets."," Pink peppercorn, juniper berry, cardamom, cypress, frankincense, calamus, Black ceylan tea, cistus, Bourbon vanilla, vanilla pod, vetyver, cypriol, ambroxin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483139.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Korrigan Eau de Parfum,2747,Lubin," Korrigan is less harmless than it looks. This caramel wood is no perfume from childhood; it is a scent of intimacy, insidiously musky and irresistible on the skin of a desired being. It is the fragrance of the senses set free, to be shared or saved for intimate moments, when caresses follow on sweet whispers and bodies draw closer. It is an invitation to voluptuousness, to sensuous pleasures, and to fantasies of the most extravagant kind.Perfumer Thomas Fontaine first of all imagined a tree for Lubin, to be called“Caramel Wood”. Its sap would be sweet like English toffee, but with tangy accents of wild apple, juniper and saffron, to answer for some of its mystery. He wanted a note of leather yet appetising, smooth like a whisky cream liqueur, yet smoky, fragrant and slightly bitter like superb pure malt."," Juniper berry, saffron, cognac, Lavender, ambrette, whiskey, Cedar, oudh, leather, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31220.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bois d'Ascese Eau de Parfum,1472,Naomi Goodsir," A meditative swirl of serene incense, intensified by smoked wood. At first, this brings to mind a stark, secluded chapel and a life of plain and simple pleasures. But as it develops, notes of whiskey, tobacco and cinnamon begin to shimmer through the incense, and you start to think that perhaps these pleasures won't be quite so plain, after all. If you have ever enjoyed a fine Islay Scotch whiskey, such as Lagavulin or Laphroaig, you are familiar with the way the intricacies of smoke and moss add a complicated and enigmatic appeal – harsh and medicinal one moment, mesmerizing the next. The layers of smoked cade wood, oakmoss and whiskey have a similar effect here, as bracing jolts of smoke morph into the airy tranquility of incense, keeping us endlessly intrigued and hopelessly addicted.  A starkly elegant fragrance that puts us in a trance.All Naomi Goodsir Parfums include an atomizer spray."," tobacco, whiskey, cinnamon, amber, cistus labdanum, oakmoss, smoked cade wood, Somalian incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/59301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Philosykos - Eau de Parfum,2821,Diptyque," One of the best fig scents ever made and one of our favorite scents of all time, now even stronger and more compelling.  This ode to the fig groves of Greece is still a very green fig – a fig just on the verge of being ripe. The opening is sharp with the tart freshness of the leaves, and then the fig itself comes into play – sweet enough to tantalize, but not overwhelm. The glossy green leaves and succulent fruit intertwine with a dry wood note and a hint of rich earth. You get the sense not only of the whole tree, but the whole grove – the wood, the earth, the sky, the Mediterranean sun coaxing the sweetness of the fruit along as it ripens. Many a superlative has been used to describe this fragrance over the years and it deserves every one. Outstanding."," Fig tree leaves, wood, white cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1969 Eau de Parfum,1059,Histoires de Parfums," The carnal sensuality of a voluptuous bunch of spices.

Jardin du Poete Eau de Toilette,2936,Eau d'Italie," Eau d'Italie teams up again with Bertrand Duchaufour for this lyrical interpretation of an al fresco dinner in a Sicilian garden. Orange in every tone – tart, bitter, sweet – is livened up with grapefruit, whose raspy, slightly sulfurous facets are underlined with cassis and the minty buchu leaf; basil conjures the aromatic herbal garden. These green facets, as well as the rosy undertones of the grapefruit segue into the green, watery, rose-like cyclamen, a natural companion to lily of the valley and rose providing a rich, moist, floral counterpoint to the sparkle of citrus... Immortelle, moss and hay conjure the heat exhaled by vegetation as the sun sets after a warm summer day. Like its source of inspiration, the“Poet's Garden” manages to find a perfect balance between citrus, herbal, floral and wood notes; between the vitality of nature in the Mediterranean, and the harmonious, millennial Mediterranean culture."," Green orange, sweet orange, bitter orange, grapefruit, blackcurrant, petitgrain, buchu leaf, basil, angelica, cardamom, pink bay, cyclamen, lily of the valley, rose, moss, immortelle, cypress, hay, musk.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/43218.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau Duelle - Eau de Toilette,1581,Diptyque," Eau Duelle is a vibrant dash of cold spices - cardamom, pink peppercorn and saffron - and the intoxicating juniper essence hits new heights with fresh cypress and elemi aromatic tinges. Then the vanilla emerges triumphant against the light and dark backdrop.On the one hand, there is ethereal, epicurean and powdery Firnat vanilla, its enthralling sweetness exalted by paradisone - a Firmenich captive molecule akin to an infinitely pure hedione - and by white, sweet and enveloping musks.On the other, there is original and mysterious bourbon vanilla. It is slightly smoked and almost syrupy. Vetiver, African frankincense smoke, and animal and leathery twists from Asian cypriol purify it. A spice trail necessarily travels through places where unexpected exchanges occur.The gatecrashers here are black tea from Ceylon and the famous calamus reed, the tasty revealers that make the journey singular, memorable and priceless. Eau Duelle will delight anyone who dreams of breathing vanilla with a different tinge. It is neither languid nor docile: it is enthralling in an all-new way."," Cardamom, Asian cyprus, elemi, juniper, saffron, calamus, black tea, black African olibanum, amber, Firnat Vanilla, Bourbon Vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48314.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tilda Swinton Like This Eau de Parfum,2007,Etat Libre d'Orange," With Like This, Etat Libre d'Orange pays homage to the intelligent and surreally beautiful actress Tilda Swinton. Etat's challenge was immediate: to create a fragrance that reflects Swinton's uncommon grace and talent. Like Swinton, the fragrance needed to be unusual yet welcoming, delicate yet strong, seductive without being distracting, and full of radiance. With Like This, they succeeded. Like This is unlike any other fragrance we've smelled, and yet it is as comfortable and warm as a summer afternoon in the Scottish hillside.The fragrance opens with a juicy hit of neroli and mandarin, and it is quickly balanced by the earthiness of pumpkin flesh, a note rarely found in perfume. A thread of exotic immortelle and powdered ginger add both sweetness and spice to the composition. But don't think Like This smells like the pantry”” a lush bouquet of rose, heliotrope, and green vetiver are the foundation on which the scent is built, and a hint of clean musk adds intimacy. Like This wears for hours, yet stays close to the skin. Like This follows Swinton's lead in breaking artistic convention. The only real way to understand either of them is to experience them."," Yellow mandarin, ginger, pumpkin accord, immortelle, Moroccan neroli, rose de Grasse, vetiver, heliotrope, and musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47725.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nio Eau de Parfum,2825,Xerjoff," Xerjoff describes Nio as“A refreshing walk through the south Italian countryside, ” and they couldn't be more right. Wearing Nio,  we imagine strolling down a shady,  cypress-lined lane in the height of summer,  just before the sun sets. It's that special time between day and night,  the time the French refer to as the blue hour. A slight breeze lifts from a nearby ocean,  cooling the warm air and mingling with the fresh,  herbal scent of the trees and their woody bark. Soon night will fall and the crickets will begin to chirp. We're thinking of the chilled Campari and good company waiting at the villa just ahead. Nio opens with a mouthwatering blend of rich neroli and Calabrian bergamot before deepening into its resinous,  green heart. Hints of spice,  pepper,  and dry cedar enliven the composition,  and vetiver keeps Nio's refreshing fragrance grounded. Unlike many green,  earthy fragrances,  Nio doesn't fade into a vague woody shadow.

Philosykos - Eau de Toilette,2770,Diptyque," One of the best fig scents ever made and one of our favorite scents of all time. Philosykos is an ode to the fig groves of Greece. Created by Olivia Giacobetti, this is a very green fig – a fig on the verge of being ripe. The opening is sharp with the tart freshness of the leaves, and then the fig itself comes into play – sweet enough to tantalize, but not overwhelm. The glossy green leaves and succulent fruit intertwine with a dry wood note and a hint of rich earth. You get the sense not only of the whole tree, but the whole grove – the wood, the earth, the sky, the Mediterranean sun coaxing the sweetness of the fruit along as it ripens. Many a superlative has been used to describe this fragrance over the years and it deserves every one. Outstanding."," fig tree leaves, wood, white cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48308.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Jubilation XXV Eau de Parfum,2856,Amouage," Unabashedly opulent. There is nothing minimal about this celebratory elixir and we couldn't be happier about that. Let's face it, sometimes more is more. Jubilation XXV features the prized frankincense of the Sultanate of Oman, but this is not a meditative, stone cathedral type of incense fragrance. This is a lavish bazaar, packed to the brim with all of the treasures of 1001 nights.  The silver frankincense weaves through burnished woods, luscious fruits and blood-warming spices. It teases the elusive rock rose and the ever-so-grand orchid and wraps itself around luxurious opoponax and amber. The opening is sweet and honeyed, with a hint of bitterness that reminds us of the aftertaste that lets you know when a fruity liqueur is going to pack a wallop. (Fans of Frapin 1270 may want to join us in enjoying this deep and satisfying fruity booziness). As the scent mellows, it becomes richer and the wood notes become prominent. In spite of the litany of intense and dark-sounding notes, this never becomes gothic or moody. The aura is warm and velvety and extremely content, like you are leaning against a great golden lion who is purring like a race car. This is designed for men, yet somewhere deep down inside we know there is no way the women of the world are going to let the guys keep something this fantastic all to themselves."," Frankincense, labdanum ciste, coriander, davana, blackberry, orange, gaicwood, rose, honey, bay, orchid, cinnamon, clove, celery seed, opoponox, patchouli, myrrh, musk, moss, atlas cedarwood, ambergris, oud, immortelle",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Phtaloblue Eau de Parfum,2614,Tauer Perfumes," While everyone loves the sparkling brightness of an aquatic scent, it's hard to deny that the vast majority of them are all a bit... repetitive. So when we say Phtaloblue, with its distinct and invigorating blend of herbaceous and woody aquatic accords, is a breath of fresh air, please understand that we mean that in every possible sense. We'd expect nothing less from one of the most uniquely creative perfumers we know. Phtaloblue explodes off the skin with a delightfully bracing burst of oceanic freshness, salt water mingled with vibrant citrus, but also a distinctive and captivating note of sweet, aromatic fennel that instantly imparts a warm, sensual dimension. It's the perfect opening for a scent that provides cool comfort and provocative originality on every level, as a floral heart balances the classic sophistication of orange blossom and lavender against a second, more herbaceous fennel and geranium chord that crackles with electric energy.

Kira Kira Eau de Parfum,2407,Strangers Parfumerie," The heat of summertime in Japan: families gathered in city parks, enjoying a picnic under the brilliant sun which sparkles from the windows of a thousand surrounding skyscrapers in a kaleidoscopic radiance that has a wonderfully onomatopoetic Japanese name: kira kira. Represented here in the form of fragrance, Kira Kira is a delightfully buoyant, exceptionally zen fruity musk scent that weaves Japanese minimalism together with the universal appeal of a day in the summer sun. The very first sniff of Kira Kira is sure to put a smile on anyone's face, combining the energetic snap of fresh mint and tart green apple with the luscious, mouthwatering smoothness of a perfectly ripe pear. The smooth, fresh heart marries the refreshing greenness of lily with the solar glow of hedione, all set against the comforting, gently fruity musk of ambrette spiked with a touch of sake.

Iridescent Sky Eau de Parfum,2946,Strangers Parfumerie," Picture a sweltering but overcast midsummer afternoon in New York City- the puffy clouds hanging low amongst the skyscrapers, backlit by the setting sun to achieve a multi-toned crimson glow.

Iridescent Sky is the smell of that moment. On every level, Iridescent Sky weds a vivacious, juicy summer freshness to smoky cityscape. Bright citrus, juicy blueberry and sweet pineapple are cut with the gentle darkness of black tea, while the smooth rose and orris heart is spiked with a fiery, earthy vetiver.

Magenta Pop Eau de Parfum,1467,Strangers Parfumerie," To Prin Lomros, the hopes and fears, triumphs and failures of young love can be represented by a somewhat unlikely avatar: pop rocks. It's not as crazy as it might seem- aside from being a reliable source of childhood nostalgia, the fizzy, exploding candy is just like the experiences that make up the romantic awakening of adolescence: sweet, painful, exciting, unpredictable, and fleeting. This is the concept behind Magenta Pop, a candy-inspired summer scent of sweet, juicy, occasionally painful romance. Magenta Pop is built around grape, but not the fruity dimensionality of a wine or table grape- the flattened purple sweetness of the ubiquitous candy flavor, syrupy and indulgent. Contrast, therefore, comes with the electric spices meant to convey the crackle of the candy: black pepper, coriander, cinnamon, ginger. Languid honeycomb adds a sugary crunch, while an undercurrent of boozy red wine and animalic leather hint at the deeper, more adult pleasures down the road. If you'd like a grape scent with a bit of grown-up challenge hidden on the edges, Magenta Pop is a testament to coming of age that will make your mouth water- and your heart flutter."," Grape, amber, blueberry, honeycomb, rose, orris, coriander, black pepper, gingerbread, licorice, red wine, leather, atlas cedar, mandarin orange, tobacco, caramel, civet, cinnamon",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eternal Summer Eau de Parfum,1316,Strangers Parfumerie," A green tea field surrounded by a bamboo forest, Eternal Summer takes the summertime theme of Strangers Parfumerie's latest batch of releases and transposes it to a near-mythical plane with a scent that hides impressive sophistication beneath a nearly ethereal first impression. On first sniff, Eternal Summer is a blindingly bright and blissful fruity citrus, featuring the unique facets of fresh kumquat and juicy pear. But a moment's development reveals a gorgeous field of wild green grass, smooth, gentle rose, and a purely lovely green tea note that's nutty, earthy, smooth, and green, all at once. The bamboo forest surrounding it feels appropriately lush, with the gentle strength of gaiac wood and vetiver bringing all elements back together with the perfect touch of honeysuckle. It's remarkably easy to wear, but to call it simple would be a mistake- Eternal Summer is, instead, just a perfect summer scent for any green tea lover."," Kumquat, neroli, pear, grass, rose, bamboo, gaiac, sandalwood, green tea, oakmoss, vetiver, honeysuckle",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Comme Un Carrousel Eau de Parfum,2082,Strangers Parfumerie," Summertime nostalgia isn't limited to the innocent bike rides and backyards of pre-adolescence- just as powerfully evocative are the memories (and half-memories) of teenage transgression, the furtive gatherings in cheap hotel rooms and after-dark beaches full of cheap booze, cigarettes, and nervous, hopeful yearning. That's the smell of Comme Un Carrousel, inspired by the wildness of the beach festival season in Nice, France. It's an intoxicating swirl of boozy rum and red wine, smoky tobacco, fizzy cola, and fiery spices that creates an undeniable evocation of the giddy highs and emotional depths of young lovers risking it all night after night. Surprisingly complex, deeply nostalgic, Comme Un Carrousel is the best party your 17 year old self ever attended."," Cola, rum, red wine, red apple, honey, basil, rose, orange flower, cinnamon, coconut, clove, tobacco, vanilla, myrrh, amber, ginger",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842014.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Created as a bespoke perfume for Rajesh Balkrishnan by Prin Lomros, HÃ¤xan is a dark witchy fougere style perfume which incorporates dark woody and aromatic elements on a mossy bed representative of the ambience of the smells of places where dark occult ceremonies were conducted.The perfume uses three blends of natural lavender oil surrounded by woody resinous birch, cedar, fir, guaiac, cypriol, sandalwood, wormwood, styrax and pine needle. There are spicy and herbal notes of saffron, thyme, rosemary, black pepper, nutmeg, caraway, cinnamon, violet leaf, tobacco, mushroom, basil, marjoram, and vetiver.

The perfume exudes an air of aromatic mystery and is a shape shifting marvel that ebbs and flows in alternate hues of dark and light.In spite of its dense and dark notes, this is a surprisingly wearable and not overly intense concoction that takes you on a ride into the dark unknown of magic and ancient practices of the surreal considered heretic and profane."," Chamomile, saffron, galbanum, lavender, rosemary, clary sage, marjoram, wormwood, sage, jasmine absolute, cypress absolute, fir balsam, spruce, beeswax absolute, elemi, thyme, basil, oregano, incense, labdanum, goat hair tincture, styrax, opoponax, nutmeg, gaiac, clove, black pepper, caraway, tobacco absolute, castoreum, cedar, sandalwood, cashmeran, mushroom, vetiver, patchouli, muscone",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Tuberose & Moss Eau de Toilette,2693,Rogue Perfumery," With striking facets that range from innocently soft to sinfully carnal, tuberose is a grand dame of perfumery, a floral that a perfumer could dedicate a lifetime to. And Manuel Cross' third installment of tuberose is his most creative yet: while Flos Mortis was a snarling bouquet of indole (and Champs Lunaires a smooth and gentle dream), Tuberose & Moss focuses on tuberose's sweet, fruity elements, and in doing so demonstrates that this complex floral can do joyful and bright just as well as dark or soft. And what better base to showcase the sunshine than a classically inflected chypre? Here, Cross plays a fruity, creamy tuberose- delivering the brightness and sweetness that traditionally come from citrus and resin- against a beautiful base of soft, green, real oakmoss. Touches of spice, vanilla, and woods round out the rich dimensionality of the tuberose, and a traditional note of labdanum keeps the tuberose tethered to a chypre structure. Yet again, Manuel Cross has given us a scent that shows us that while both beautiful raw materials or inspired creativity can produce a great fragrance, it's the intersection of the two that can truly speak to the spirit."," Tuberose, Oakmoss, Vanilla Cream, Allspice Berries, Cedar, Labdanum, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

La Surprise Eau de Parfum,1426,Parfums MDCI," Inspired by The Pursuit, one of four paintings that make up Jean-HonorÃ© Fragonard's ""The Process of Love"" collection, La Surprise is a bright and striking vintage-inflected feminine scent. The painting, meant to depict the first stage of love- courtship- shows a bold young man emerging into a garden where three young ladies are playing in a fountain, offering a rose to his beloved, who turns away in surprise. It's a painting of clever nuance, the outcome uncertain to all involved, from the unsteady suitor to the blushing courtesan to even the apprehensive cherub sculptures who loom above. It's a message, perhaps, about the risks one must take to find love, but also the triumphs that only such risks can produce. As such, La Surprise is a burst of bright, elegant energy, opening with a lovely spicy-green accord that would feel at home among the most romantic French chypres of years past. A heart of luscious white florals meets the timeless pairing of peach and a touch of solar aldehyde, while The Pursuit's singular rose stands out as if carried on the breeze. In appropriately vintage fashion, the base is musky in the traditional use of the term, with enough of a warm, furry animalic purr to evoke the very real desire that lays beneath our subjects' interaction. Parfums MDCI have proven their skill in exploring every facet of France's rich fragrance history; with La Surprise, they gift us with a classically green feminine floral that would be right at home a century ago."," Green accord, cardamom, white flowers, rose, peach, woody accord, musks, solar notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36526.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Aimee Eau de Parfum,2877,Parfums MDCI," L'AimÃ©e,  or ""The Beloved, "" is a famous 1794 oil portrait from French master Jacques-Louis David depicting his sister-in-law Madam SÃ©rizat. Painted shortly after his release from Robespierre's prisons following the French Revolution,  this masterwork is renowned for its effortless depiction of the subject's humanity,  portraying Madam SÃ©rizat holding a bouquet in one hand and her child's hand in the other. Its use of soft,  warm color,  as well as subtle touches of exquisite detail on the subject's hands and face,  work together to evoke emotional depth and authenticity that transcend mere photorealism- beneath the surface,  this painting truly breathes. What a delight,  therefore,  that Parfums MDCI has taken its subject to heart,  delivering a fragrance that also glows with abundant humanity and warmth. Despite a complex notes list of citrus,  fine florals,  and rich woods,  resins,  and musks,  L'AimÃ©e turns out to be a fragrance of exquisitely blended softness and light. In a sense,  it feels classical in its romantic depth,  but it surprisingly carries none of the room-filling ostentatiousness one might expect from the notes- there are no sharp edges,  no operatic swells and transitions- instead,  it's the lush romance of a perfectly tuned chamber orchestra. Florals and woods all float on a cloud of pillow-soft musk and vanilla,  aglow with the natural light of sweet fruit and the gentlest touch of castoreum. The result is a fragrance for romantics of all ages,  youthful enough for a princess,  elegant enough for a queen. Though for Monsieur David's sake,  we should point out one needn't support the monarchy to enjoy it."," Bergamot, mandarin, blackcurrant, Bulgarian rose, Egyptian jasmine, Indian champaca, lily-of-the-valley, orange flower, heliotrope, orris, raspberry, peach, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, Haitian amyris, oakmoss, sandalwood, benzoin, styrax, tonka, vanilla, amber, ambrette, white musks, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36527.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Bohemian Lime Parfum Concentrate,2479,Goldfield & Banks," As one of the easternmost points on the Australian mainland, the gorgeous beaches of Byron Bay are known as the place where Australia first meets the daily sun. It's also home to the Australian finger lime, a small, multicolored citrus fruit treasured for its potently tangy flavor and unique appearance. While the finger lime has long been a lucrative culinary crop, its distinctive citrus character and rich, fragrant oil has never been utilized in perfumery- until now. Featuring invigorating, sun-drenched finger lime as the focal point of a robustly fresh and spicy masculine, Goldfield & Banks has once again delivered a summer scent as strikingly unique as it is easy to love.The very first spray of Bohemian Lime shows what makes the finger lime distinct- simultaneously sweet and brightly tart, with rich fruity tones and an electric aromatic undercurrent that plays beautifully off notes of Italian bergamot and coriander.

Coup de Foudre Eau de Parfum,2131,Bortnikoff," Coup de Foudre certainly earns its lightning-inspired name in the opening burst, a brightly colored flash of juicy, sweet citrus and fresh, younger florals. Indeed, the combination of fresh bergamot, bitter grapefruit and sweet orange atop sunny champaca and lush jasmine is a spectacular bouquet unto itself, the kind of gorgeous natural blend that makes you look to the skies as surely as an incandescent streak of electricity across the horizon. But Coup de Foudre is both lightning and thunder, following the arresting energy of its opening with an equally masterful floral heart that resonates with deeply romantic substance. Creamy and buttery, it's filled with sandalwood and even richer cocktail of florals such as rose, carnation, tuberose, ylang-ylang, and lily of the valley. The base, then, is the ominous stillness after the thunder, dark and heavy, yet witah a surprisingly light and gentle feel to it.

Vesna Cologne Eau de Parfum,2094,Bortnikoff," While any scent can introduce unexpected ingredients to a traditional formula, we have a special affection for those that do so with artistic purpose. Vesna Cologne is just such a fragrance, a sweet, fresh, completely wearable homage to classic eaux de cologne with a wonderfully non-traditional list of notes daringly repurposed to create the illusion of a classic citrus EDC. The sunshine of fresh lemon oil is still front and center, but in place of the spicy greenness of petitgrain, we're treated to an alluring decoction of smoothly smoky black tea and piquant tomato leaf, sweetened with a gloriously bright pineapple. Smooth, refreshing magnolia dominates the heart to provide all the water this ""eau"" might need, while a richly woody cypriol (nagarmotha) note in the base feels spicy, robust, and earthy against a sweet, almost boozy dried fruit accord. It's a wonderful olfactory illusion, a feat of scent engineering- at first sniff, a comfortable classic; upon further experience, an ingeniously unique fragrance to explore and savor."," Lemon, Black Tea, Tomato Leaf, Pineapple, Magnolia, Dried Fruits Extrait, Nagarmotha",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804021.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Moss Cologne Eau de Parfum,1808,Bortnikoff," As prolific of a creator as Dmitri Bortnikoff can be, he deserves equal credit for knowing when not to get in the way of his own exceptional ingredients. Moss Cologne is a perfect example- a showcase of gorgeous natural oakmoss absolute and its resin extracts that proudly exhibits oakmoss in all of its natural beauty, too rarely experienced in modern fragrance. Every other aspect of the scent, from the bright, invigorating citrus of the opening notes to the luxuriously smooth floral heart to the rich, robust base of balsamic woods, all exist to promote the vibrantly fresh, green, earthy character of the oakmoss and show how why it has been one of the most treasured base materials in the history of perfume. Here, it brightens and smooths citrus, adds lush and natural facets to florals, and makes the base feel simultaneously more rugged and refined. In short, it makes every aspect of the scent more complex and compelling while also making it work more effectively with every other aspect- a true miracle note. Effortlessly rich, delightfully sensual, Moss Cologne is the kind of straightforwardly elegant scent that only Bortnikoff seems to know how to make these days. We're hooked."," Bergamot, Lemon, Sweet Orange, Grapefruit, Oakmoss Absolute, Violet Leaf, Jasmine, Champaca, Ylang-Ylang, Nutmeg, Oakmoss Resinoid, Ambergris, Atlas Cedar, Virginian Cedar, Labdanum, Tonka Bean, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The sun's cheerful brightness is represented here with fresh, clean bergamot, while sweetness comes not from sugar, but instead from gorgeously yellow immortelle flower set against supporting notes of benzoin and tolu balsam, which impart subtle depth against the exquisite vanilla base. It's the kind of relaxed, upbeat elegance that L'Artisan is known for- an everyday vanilla of rare distinction."," Bergamot, immortelle, salty notes, Madagascar vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Yet within its misty depths, countless dangers lurk, slinking across the forest floor. Dangling high among the treetops may seem a dubious defence against peril, but for leisurely sloths the forest canopy offers a protective shroud. Safe in their leafy fortress, the sluggish creatures move so slowly even moss overtakes them.

9mm Eau de Parfum,1516,Ballistic Therapy," Leave it to Geza SchÃ¶en to find the soul behind a provocative concept. Ballistic Therapy 9mm- and yes, that's a real (non-live) round in the bottle- is inspired by the serendipitous discovery of gunpowder by ancient Chinese alchemists seeking an elixir of immortality, to instead stumble upon a destructive power that would change the world.

SchÃ¶en explores and expands on each facet of this complex note, supplementing with the sharpness of citrus, the fire of red pepper and cardamom, the smooth modernism of woodsy, vetiver-tinged musky leather.

In Accento Overdose, the fruity-floral bouquet still sparkles, with mouthwatering pineapple and deliciously sweet citrus fruits opening into a sumptuous Egyptian jasmine and Bulgarian rose heart that feelers even fuller and more feminine than the original. The green and balsamic facets lend a sensuous fullness, and the newly enhanced base glows with a timelessly romantic warmth.

Oud Stars - Alexandria III Parfum,1519,Xerjoff," The Alexandria series is a true achievement for Xerjoff, an elegant series of fragrances based around a rich core of exquisite florals and highest quality ouds from Southeast Asia. Each version plays out with virtuosic grandeur, finding bold new resonance in its variation- a true testament to the legendary opulence of history's greatest metropolis. For Alexandria III, the composition keeps the same notes, but shifts away from the fruit-soaked vivaciousness of previous incarnations in favor of an even richer and woodsier blend.Originally a limited edition of only 99 bottles, each encrusted in golden crystals, Alexandria III is no less radiant in its stunning new packaging. Lavender is still prominent in the opening, but now it brightens a warmer, richer heart of rosewood and lush, narcotic Bulgarian rose, softened with just the right touch of lily of the valley. The oud is every bit as profound as it was in previous iterations, but in III it leaves behind the animalic potency to follow the warm, powdered contours of a base of amber and rich sandalwood that will be wonderfully familiar to fans of Xerjoff's masterpiece Richwood. But make no mistake- with its luscious floral glow, Alexandria III is a masterwork all its own."," Palisander rosewood, lavender, cinnamon, Bulgarian rose, cedar, lily of the valley, oud, amber, sandalwood, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51154.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Even as a luscious vanilla, cashmere wood, and gaiac base emerge, the multidimensional beauty of the florals linger, connecting the romance of old New York to the vibrant excitement of its future. Glamorous and enchanting, New York 5th Avenue is a fragrance for the dreamers."," Bergamot, Rose, Caramel, Violet, Cyproil, Vanilla, Musk, Cashmere Wood, Guaiac Wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757035.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Velvet Amber,1645,Fragrance du Bois," Velvet Amber can be defined as a fresh spicy woody fragrance. It opens with spicy citrus top note coming from bergamot, geranium, lemon and cardamom, then a very sophisticated heart note mixes the charm of rose with saffron, leather and cypriol. The strong cypriol accord stays in the base note and creates a great synergetic long lasting well composed base that includes sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, musk, Oud oil and of course amber."," Bergamot, Geranium, Lemon & Cardamom, Rose, Saffron, Leather, Cypriol, Amber, Sandalwood, Patchuli, Vanilla, Musk and Oud Oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757037.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cannabis Blue Eau de Parfum,1355,Fragrance du Bois, Perfumer Christian Provenzano has created a cannabis accord that vibrates with daring Oud facets and smoky wood tones of guaiac and patchouli.

Ishtar Eau de Toilette,2982,Rogue Perfumery," Part of the joy of Rogue's dedication to exquisite natural materials- regulators be damned- is a spontaneity of creation that simply cannot come from synthetic-heavy, bottom-line-oriented mass market creations. Ishtar is a perfect example- originally conceived as an aromatic fresh scent with a woodsy base, it turned out quite a bit different, as Manuel Cross found that two of the notes meant for the background- a smoky, silvery frankincense and a sweet, resinous benzoin- kept rising to the top of the composition regardless of proportions. Luckily, he was able to realize the serendipity at play, and the result is a dynamic, gorgeous incense scent with a wonderfully fresh sweetness. Juniper and lily, perhaps the star players in a different fragrance, go to work here enhancing the brightest and cleanest aspects of the frankincense, helping massage the profile from cold, churchy starkness into something greener, fresher, and more exuberantly lively. Similarly, the benzoin blends perfectly with sweet, woodsy myrrh and a spot of sandalwood- not a rough edge to be found. If Ishtar wasn't meant to be an incense scent, it might not have turned out quite as planned. Then again, nothing truly inspired ever does."," Frankincense, benzoin, juniper, myrrh, lily, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Jasmin Antique Eau de Toilette,2170,Rogue Perfumery," Jasmine lovers, listen closely- you know how Rogue Perfumery has built a reputation for delivering impossibly full-bodied, deeply evocative perfumes unencumbered by regulatory blandness?

It's a massive, luscious fragrance, with every wondrous aspect of jasmine harmonizing with the rest to achieve a blissfully narcotic white floral. If you're anything like us, you'll be sniffing your wrists all day, discovering something new each time. Jasmine scents like Jasmin Antique don't come along every day- but don't take our word for it."," Jasmine Grandiflorum blossoms, musk, clove, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Flos Mortis Eau de Toilette,2702,Rogue Perfumery," Flos Mortis (flower of death) seems a bit dark and droll for a perfume concept but there is nothing dead or dull about it. This hardcore tuberose fragrance is a narcotic floral composed to be an indolic dirge, headed by tuberose and Indian jasmine. The composition focuses on Tuberose's indolic properties from both the fresh blossoms and the absolute. The indole note in Flos Mortis actually makes up 5% of the formula but is tempered with some Indian jasmine (grandiflorum) which shares similar indolic properties. The addition of red currant and osmanthus add some smooth and delicious fruitiness, while the raw black leather leather accord carries forth the rest of the animalic onslaught.From its sweet, dark floral opening to its leathery mid-notes Flos Mortis is nowhere near conventional. It's a fascinating Victorian beast whose inciting snarl dares you to revel in a liminal space of beauty and darkness. A true work of wonder that is sure to hold a treasured place in your own cabinet of curiosities."," Indolic Tuberose Absolute, Indian Jasmine, Osmanthus, Red Currant, Leather, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Sedley Eau de Parfum,2033,Parfums de Marly," A fragrance of unparalleled freshness and deceptive complexity, Sedley is a dynamically bright men's fragrance for those who know the power of confident subtlety. While it doesn't enter the room in front of you the way many of Parfums de Marly's powerhouse classics do, its bright, light aromatic citrus opening steadily develops on the skin into a beguiling woodsy masculine that hits its stride just as you hit yours. But first, a bit more about that opening- a hesperidic trio of mandarin, grapefruit, and lemon that combines the best of all three- tart, bright, juicy, and sharp, with the herbaceous, aromatic zing of mint and rosemary. Sedley's development is impressively judicious- the top notes linger well past a normal opening, and the classic gentleman's heart of lavender and geranium comes on so gradually that you may find yourself seduced by your own fragrance. And with that same deliberation, a warm, smooth, powerful base of musky woods emerges that hums on the skin with potent energy. It's often said that real men speak softly and let their actions do the talking. If that's you, Sedley is your fragrance."," Mandarin, grapefruit, lemon, mint, rosemary, geranium, lavender, olibanum, sandalwood, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, cashmeran, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70033.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tigerlust Pure Parfum,2486,Ensar Oud," Typically, perfumers have a vision in mind, be it a feeling they want to evoke or a marketing theme they have to match. It didn't work that way this time. This fragrance was simply born out of Ensar Oud's love of contrasts and experimentation. A curiosity to know what happens when frangipani oozes into orris root and civet gets high on Sichuan pepper. When crushed ambergris sticks to blackcurrant and castoreum goes for a swim in a lake of osmanthus. When obscene amounts of artisanal Chinese oud, Sri Lankan oud, and Maroke oud are poured into an animalic cocktail and then left to steep in vintage Timor sandalwood, tobacco leaf and coffee flower, you really just don't know what to expect. Enter Tigerlust. Primal, sensual ”” sexual, even”” this is what happens when Siberian musk comes into contact with gyrinops from the highest mountain peaks of Irian Jaya and they go for a stroll in the Italian countryside.It's a fragrance you want to embrace; to make it a part of you every bit as much as the steaming presence of an untamed lover's skin. An enticing musk, with rose and jasmine hastening it's intrigue. The top notes are discreetly citrusy, the heart notes shamelessly saucy, and the base is all ouds slooshing drunk on oud, tempered by Mysore from the mid-70s. All the most expensive/sought-after/precious perfume ingredients here, waiting to be experienced. Decadent amounts of all of them in their most pristine form (100% natural, undiluted extracts), carefully proportioned not to let any one steal the show.Beautifully hand-bound in embossed full-grain Italian calf hide by Habib Dingle, leather sage of the century.","Citrus, Fruit, Sweet Aromatic spices, Herbs, Aromatic Woods, Sandalwood, Siberian musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Naga Layyen Organic Oud Pure Oud,1843,Ensar Oud," A cocktail of spiced plums, tangy nectarines, and ginger-infused black tea awaits.

People's Kampot Organic Oud Pure Oud,2026,Ensar Oud," People's Kampot is the cry of the jungle. The bulk of the agarwood distilled was wild, collected along the mountain range where Koh Kong meets Pursat  and where the trees are decades old.This oil boasts a medicinal red, bitter-fruity accord infused with the resinous core of an old Kampot oud. This oud has just enough rawness to compliment the oolong, tobacco leaf, and lightly smoked puerh. A refreshing tamarind tartness with a minty zing that is bursting with fruit. Very long lasting on the skin, a scent to be relished all day long all the way through its scrumptious peppery base drydown.","oolong, tobacco leaf, smoked puerh, accord, tamarind",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800029.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Satori Fusho Organic Oud,1089,Ensar Oud," Frangisteria might be the best name to describe this oud's heartnote, a see-through crispness that purrs with Thai frangipani and Western wisterias, infused with gently steeped Japanese green tea. The incense notes are so delicate, richly layered. The top notes are pristine and crystalline. An ethereal kukicha-matcha leaf note that seeps throughout your wear.

American Oud,1549,Ensar Oud," A smell that brings to life Hemingway's bullfighting, marlin-chasing madness and reminds you of the sweaty Strauss days of rough love and worn leather out on the road. A rich chocolatey smoky leather oud often compared to the infamous Tigerwood Royale. Indulge in the glory of an Oud that breathes out the resinous ooze of old-school Sumatran agar, bathed in the nose-piercing green incense of walla. What's best is how this intoxicating brew works with your skin and brings to life your own natural pheromonal aroma, just like on that day on the boat with the marlin hanging high, when you biked home after. That's what good perfumes ought to do. Get ready to bask in its complexity and enjoy the ride.","Chocolatey, Smoky, Leather, Resinous, Sumatran agar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800019.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

This santal boasts the most vanillicious citrus twang and musky aroma you could imagine. Often santal oils are deployed as a supporting carrier in attars but it would be unthinkable to not enjoy this precious olfactory gem on its own. A complete perfume in its own right, replete with notes of spices, animalics, mind-bending floral chords and, of course, a to-die-for woody drydown that is unparalleled.Here is a truly formidable feat of olfaction: a scent that is at once sublimely linear yet potent and rich.

Bliss du Boche Oud Pure Oud,2535,Ensar Oud," Like a bouquet made of many kinds of flowers, this oud oil gathers different batches of agarwood from all over Cambodia to create a distillation that gives you fantastically prismatic floral tones, rounded off with just the right amount of fruity zest to make this one Ensar Oud's most treasured brews.On top of the robustness of the aroma, the integrity of the scent (how the heart of the fragrance remains intact down through the drydown), the artisanal execution of the distillation, you'll delight in rich fruity chords, spiced molasses, violet leaf and lilac held together by a soft chai creaminess.Bliss du Boche is so exotic it demands to be worn.

Sultan Musk Attar Perfume Oil,2231,Ensar Oud," All spiced up and sumptuous. A sensual, naturalistic aroma that smells of animal yet enthralls with its beauty. This is the scent of a passionate caress. From Siberian musk-infused Santal Royale to exotic pepper extracts that smell muskier than muskrat, splashes of post-coital sweat, grapefruit and animalics emerge that take you to a proper bestial muskiness accentuated by civet, cumin, and other highly problematic aromatics. They merge into an ultra-steroidal foundation for the floral  notes. After the floral notes quieten, the soft basmati rice emerges, the baby skin effect of a perfect musky drydown.A special Japanese rose injects the risquÃ© with enough romantique to let the scent share the bed with the ballroom; featured here alongside a trio of Himalayan, Turkish, and Edward roses. The floral tenor is sensual and richer than the most masterful soliflores but exalted further by the musk. All the while Sambac looms regally on top, adding to the complexity of the heartnotes, rendering them into a delicious blend of pepper and spice. It is a jasminized spicy and musky carnality that comes for you whether you like it or not.","Muskrat, post-coital sweat, Grapefruit, Animalics, Siberian musk, Exotic Pepper, civet, cumin, Japanese Rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800024.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Namasoma Organic Oud Pure Oud,1057,Ensar Oud," Artisanal oud oil is rich and complex, with scent notes tightly dancing together. While this oud retains a delicious fruity Thai base, Namasoma brings out a floral dimension that is unmatched. Its scent progression is slow and gives you plenty of time to get stuck amidst freesias and sweet peas before you're thrown into a mash of freshly crushed magnolia petals.Because of its super accessible floweriness, Namasoma is perfect to wear around the unaccustomed Western palette. You might just have somebody in the office cry out,“Who brought the carnations?""","Fruity, Floral, Namasoma, Freesias, Sweet Pea, Magnolia Petals, Carnations",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800027.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Spicematic Eau de Parfum,1742,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," The joy of Pierre Guillaume's ""flanker"" scents is that they're anything but retreads of their original inspiration- instead they have the iterative energy of a maestro composing variations on a theme, using the constraints of a single concept to focus his energy on the serendipitous. In Spicematic 11.2, Guillaume revisits the ""aromatic-spice"" nexus that gave us the desert lemon mint and allspice of Harmatan Noir and the sub-tropical peppermint and cardamom of Indian Wood, but here, our inspiration is the cold, mineralic beauty of marble, represented in saffron, fresh ginger, and green mint. With a molecular distillation of incense adding an intense coolness, the fragrance shines and sparkles, tempered only by the organic vibration of red cedar and the resinous heat of Siberian pine. Pierre Guillaume describes Spicematic as ""marble water."" Who are we to disagree?"," Saffron, ginger, mint, incense, red cedar, pine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34557.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Meet Me On The Corner Eau de Parfum,2874,4160 Tuesdays," Meet Me On The Corner is a fragrance inspired by the 1970s but updated by about a half century. It's named after the Lindisfarne song, and captures the days when a date was just two people showing up to the same place at the same time- no texts, no swiping right, no GPS. It takes a staple of the '70s- the citrus chypre- and supplements the carefree excitement of the classic style with a serious dose of 2020 sophistication. The key to Meet Me On The Corner is three essential oils: mandora- a hybrid citrus born of sweet orange and mandarin, grown in Cyprus- plus magnolia flower, and magnolia leaf. Mandora gives the lemon and mandarin topnote a bright new sunshiny feeling. Using magnolia instead of the traditional tuberose and rosewood brings softness to the romantic heart of the scent. And in the base, all the hallmarks of a timeless chypre- moss, patchouli and styrax blended and matured in bergamot, surrounded by gentle musks. Think of this 1970-meets-2020 concept as a new Mini Cooper- all the fun of driving the original... now with working brakes and windshield wipers."," Lemon, mandarin, mandora, clementine, magnolia flowers, magnolia leaves, sandalwood, bergamot, oakmoss, musks, styrax, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64626.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aseel Attar / Perfume Oil,1414,Fragrance du Bois," From the Arabic word for ""original, "" Aseel is a potently spicy,  yet delightfully fresh attar creation that more than lives up to its name. Featuring rich,  traditional accords well known on the Arabian peninsula such as cardamom and oud oil,  it represents both the origins of Arab culture,  while also feeling vibrantly new. Aseel opens with an electric current of ginger and cardamom amplified with the citrussy freshness of bergamot. The rich,  lively spice theme continues in the heart with coriander and nutmeg,  both in service of a stunning geranium note- fresh,  rich,  and rosy. And finally,  in the true spirit of an attar,  a potent and extremely long lasting base of two separate oud accords- Thai and Indian- which blend with smooth musk and cedarwood to create a sumptuous and sensual tapestry. Lush and layered enough to satisfy any attar lover,  yet fresh enough to wear any day,  Aseel is a standout."," Ginger, Cardamom, Bergamot, Coriander, Nutmeg, Geranium, Trat Oud Oil, White Musk, Indian Oud oil, Cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757031.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Arabesque Attar / Perfume Oil,1201,Fragrance du Bois," Elegant, lively, and enchantingly deep, Arabesque is a compellingly non-traditional attar. Opening with bright spice, jammy fruit, and tart citrus, it immediately radiates playful warmth, even before the lushly romantic heart of white oud, rose, and geranium emerge into the spotlight.

Rose Du Bois Attar / Perfume Oil,2751,Fragrance du Bois," A revolutionary Rose fragrance.Almost 90% of the blend is Damascus Rose (Ward Dimshaki), using one of the most famous and precious Rose Oils in the world, yet the fragrance with a hint of Saffron and Cardamom note then rests on the queen of flowers, the Rose. A hint of amber to add some sweetness.This attar can be identified as a powdery, fresh and floral fragrance, an intensely romantic one."," Saffron, Cardamom, Damascus Rose, Amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/757029.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aran Parfum,1348,PRIN," From the Thai for ""forest, "" Aran is an enchantingly dark voyage into a dense fantasyland teeming with both creatures and plants never before seen. Beneath a lush green canopy,  a leather scent of unparalleled animalism lurks,  with potent doses of civet and castoreum intensified by an actual goat hair extract- animalic lovers,  this may be a new holy grail. But the raw carnality is exquisitely balanced against both the wild,  herbaceous,  and earthy green notes and a potent,  spiritual incense- rich,  warm,  and uplifting. In its blend of natural and supernatural,  flora and fauna,  comfort and danger,  Aran is like ancient folklore made wearable- a scent with deep mythic power."," Goat hair, leather, frankincense, civet, castoreum, oakmoss, saffron, fir balsam, jasmine, jatamansi, cardamom, nagarmotha, tobacco, vetiver, mushroom, oud, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Anatolia Parfum,1781,PRIN," The bridge between continents, Anatolia was a nexus for the conflicting tides of humanity- a centerpoint of economic, cultural, and even genetic exchange. Anatolia the fragrance celebrates this diversity in a sweeping oriental gourmand that incorporates a multitude of unique materials that might have passed across the plateau in ancient times- the earthy richness of dried fruits made sweet with the historic confections of loukhoum and honey, contrasted against the fiery spice of cumin and cinnamon and the spiritual brightness of incense smoke. Underneath it all, the supple, road-worn leather of the travelers and merchants who brought these treasures back and forth across the silk road, creating new cultures that endure until this day. Lovers of semi-gourmande leather, you won't want to miss this one."," Leather, date, apple, oud, cinnamon, cumin, patchouli, amber, incense, loukhoum, cacao powder, honey, suede",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mandodari Parfum,2060,PRIN," Mandodari, or Montho in Thai: the queen consort of Ravana in Ramanyana, ""beautiful, pious, and righteous"": and yet, tragically exploited, ignored, and betrayed by her husband and the gods. With Mandodari, Prin Lomros honors her struggle, giving to her the redemption arc the stories never could with a sweepingly gorgeous and complex floral oriental that seamlessly melds the divine with the earthly. Mandodari is built around a sparkling bouquet of aldehyde-kissed florals- smooth, fresh champaca, sweet frangipani, narcotic tuberose, carnal gardenia. Beneath the brightness, a swirl of mysterious spices lurk- rich coffee, fiery black pepper, and an ash-enhanced curl of smoky tobacco atop a darkly woodsy base. It's a clever, empathetic nod to the darkness that lies beneath the beauty, a gesture to the unspoken tragedy of the mythology. For those who love beautiful aldehydic florals but long for a bit more substance and sophistication, Mandodari is a revelation."," Champaca, tuberose, gardenia, frangipani, aldehydes, coffee absolute, opium, black pepper, civet*, tobacco, oakmoss, ash, cumin, sandalwood, teak. *does not contain any actual animal products",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mriga Parfum,1741,PRIN," Mriga- from the Sanskrit word for ""deer."" Fear not, however, animal lovers, Mriga contains no actual deer musk, but simply an ingenious synthetic deer musk accord, perhaps the most accurate one we've ever smelled, able to impressively capture the subtly sweet, powdery, furry aspects of real musk with far more nuance than the average substitute. And Prin Lomros makes the most of this striking accord, supplementing it with an array of florals and resins designed both to evoke the natural Himalayas habitat that such a deer might find himself in, while also drawing out the aphrodisiac elements of deer musk that have brought the material such breathless renown. Lime teases out that ribbon of brightness that so often separates real musk from its imitators, while a root-to-leaf collage of arboreal fragrant materials- fir balsam, spruce, oakmoss, sandalwood- lend a striking natural dimensionality. Invigorating and substantial, Mriga is a dream come true for anyone who would love a true deer musk scent without the ethical dilemma."," Deer musk accord*, lime, fir balsam, black spruce, grass, cade, oakmoss, oud, vetiver, nagarmotha, rose, sandalwood, jasmine, costus, wormwood, labdanum, peat *this fragrance contains no animal products",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/847003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Indonesian and Indian Vetiver combine for a tantalizingly rich and naturalistic accord. Jasmine Sambac in the heart of the scent is combined with the unique addition of sandalwood oil which has been infused with champaca flowers and leaves. In the base of the scent, smooth and luxurious Bengalian and Indian sandalwood meet grey and white amber and oak moss for a classic foundation. The exotic sensuousness of sweet oud from Trat blends with precious myrrh to provide an intriguingly dark and opulent undertone.The meticulous search for the perfect ingredients and the painstaking distillation processes used by perfumer Dmitry Bortnikoff mean that, like the original Vetiver Nocturne, this fragrance will surprise and amaze those who felt that they had understood all that vetiver has to offer.  Furnished with the ideal surrounding accords, this long established perfume ingredient now reveals hitherto undiscovered facets of its complex olfactory personality."," Indonesian Vetiver, Neroli, Indian Vetiver, Jasmin Sambac, Champaca Flowers and Leaves infused in Sandalwood oil, Bengalian Sandalwood, Indonesian Sandalwood, Grey and White Amber, Oakmoss, Sweet Oud from Trat, Myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Sinharaja Extrait de Parfum,1236,Bortnikoff," Oud Sinharaja is a unique, one of a kind fragrance harnessing the beauty of the essential oil of wild oud from Sri Lanka. This oil is distilled personally by perfumer Dmitry Bortnikoff and is therefore a truly special and inimitable ingredient.This spectacular evocation of the Sinharaja rainforest in Sri Lanka will inspire and enliven you with its ethereal beauty and seductive complexity. Oud Sinharaja is a tribute to the exotic delights of the fruits, flowers and plants of this exotic wonderland and the enigmatic mystery of oud.Zesty bergamot and pink grapefruit provide a bright and invigorating opening, perfectly complimented by the smooth spiciness of cardamom. The floral heart of the scent comprises luscious frangipani, exquisite magnolia and the timeless beauty of jasmine sambac. In the base of the perfume, crisp cedar wood blends with resinous labdanum and the magical aroma of wild oud from Sri Lanka.The scent has a fresh and airy quality which is instantly appealing and which belies the complexity of the many accords which have been masterfully blended to produce it. The juicy citrus and breezy floral tones make this a perfect scent for any occasion. The rare and exotic oud at the base of the scent provides a rich and exotic counterpoint which works in perfect harmony, complimenting but never overpowering the other notes."," Bergamot, Pink Grapefruit, Cardamom, Frangipani, Magnolia, Jasmine Sambac, Essential oil of Wild Oud from Sri Lanka, Atlas Cedar, Labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Ambergris Parfum Extrait,1319,Anonim," Black Ambergris is an enveloping fragrance that builds off the natural depth and velvety texture of natural ambergris to present the luxurious ambience of an exclusive private lounge. Sumptuously rich and intoxicating notes of dark chocolate, balsamic resins, and smoothly smoky incense give a feeling of enveloping serenity, while the elegance of black ambergris, chosen for its almost gourmand-adjacent sweetness, evokes the mouthwatering, deeply warming sensations of a perfectly crafted bespoke cocktail.

Silver Ambergris Parfum Extrait,1841,Anonim," This perfume captures the atmosphere of a deserted island gleaming in the sparkling mist of warm ocean waters heated by the mid-day sun. Revealed upon approach is an enchanted landscape: a whole isle covered with dense, emerald green, fantastically-shaped, entangled trees, their crowns sprinkled with flowers that fill the air with an intoxicating, mystic blossom bouquet."," tropical flowers and spicy citruses, silver ambergris, woods and moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/844001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Golden Ambergris Parfum Extrait,1112,Anonim," Here we have a very provocative aroma with a distinctive accent of powerful animal magnetism; a concoction of scents that is reminiscent of exclusive leather goods.

Medullary-ray Eau de Parfum,2449,Jorum Studio," The metallic rasp of blade against ancient timber, the aroma of fresh shavings and static heartwood curls.Medullary-ray presents a floating balance of intimate tensions. The handling of opposing materials creates a sympathetic space before unifying to produce a hypnotic fibrous signature. Savory fruits and dry botanicals lift this inceptive sawdust profile; a fresco of gilded flowers and grasses enriched with balsamic resins. Voluminous layers of bronzed wood tones stabilize Medullary-ray creating a profound texture, faÃ§ade and resonance. A cadence of root and smoke creates an ethereal trail that enthralls. Look out for the glimmers of saccharine red fruits, delicious if caught, even if only momentarily. Medullary-ray is an olfactory encounter between crafted wood and lazily harvested Tuscan fruits."," Fig-leaf, Cardamom, Olive, Juniper, Frankincense, Orris Butter, Rose Absolute, Pomegranate, Myrrh, Vetiver, Guaic wood, Papyrus, Hay, Birch, Cedar wood, Castoreum, Valerian, Sandalwood Oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/846001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Carduus Eau de Parfum,2255,Jorum Studio," Unashamedly polarizing, Carduus is a blend of jagged leaves, herbal seeds and xeric barks.Carduus assaults with a potent crash of warm gustatory herbs, tingling seeds and defensive leaves. This dry herbal bouquet prevails over medicinal botanicals, ardent barks and bruised molecules. The resulting effect conjures images of untold ceremony and ritual. The fragrance flirts with tradition; aged herbs and spices blended alchemically, it is ceremonious and spiritual. This romantic brew is woven with bundles of complex flower essences and fermented leaves before revealing its sweet confections and pounded roots. There is unusual buoyancy experienced with Carduus. Starting extremely rich, dense and laced with spices before shedding layers to reveal a veiled and noble incense facet that feels weightless."," Chamomile, Bengal Pepper, Honey, Clary Sage, Sea-holly, Marjoram Tea, Myrtle, Rose Absolute, Vetch, Clove Bud, Hart's Tongue, Tuberose, Musk-thistle, Heliotrope, Tormentil, Mahogany, Cocoa Absolute, Tobacco, Meum, Deertongue, Cherrywood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/846002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Trimerous Eau de Parfum,2158,Jorum Studio," Trimerous is a funny little thing. A triptych of veils shading the finest facets of prized orris root.Quivering around the most exquisite Florentine Orris Butter, Trimerous presents undulating olfactory movements, displaying singular facets of the revered root in a landscape of dewy, verglas and silvered woods. Trimerous does not explore every kaleidoscopic nuance of the noble root, instead honoring but three slivers often overlooked. Trimerous highlights the forgotten, muted and the discarded; effervescent, buttery and exalting. Trimerous is as much an attempt to capture a mood and a process as it is to showcase the aromatic splendor of the iris, an inherently faultless raw material. This is a ballad to the devoted hand, soiled, aged yet resiliently tending to rhizome."," Carrot Seed, Bergamot, Nectarine, Thyme, Cicely, Pink Pepper, Juniper, Cloudberry, Angelica Root, Orris Butter, Kombucha, Centaury, Suede, Oud, Musk, Ambergris, Styrax, Vanilla, Incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/846003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Phloem Eau de Parfum,2929,Jorum Studio," What a sticky mess. Phloem is a diabolical assemblage of odorants that should oppose, but somehow attract.There is a violent, primal sensuality that bewitches before embracing. The entire composition is a balancing act of contradicting raw materials blended instinctually to create a shocking and diffusive bouquet of devastating release. Phloem presents a miasma of olfactory sin; flushed skin, shoreline, carnival frivolities, caviar, lipstick smears and erogenous effluvium. Sucrose-sweetness is tempered with greasy spices that hinder Phloem from sliding into tooth-achingly sweet territory. A damp note of nutty driftwood and hot gooey styrax gum continues deep into the fade. Phloem is hallucinogenic vapor with a marbled psychedelic development."," Passion Fruit, Rhubarb, Mulberry, Nasturtium, Honeysuckle, Blaeberry, Camellia, Oysterplant, Meadowsweet, Gorse, Ambrette, Sesame, Amyris, Tonka Bean Absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/846004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nectary Eau de Parfum,2442,Jorum Studio," Nectary is a profusion of diaphanous flowers. A modern alternative to more traditional signatures.This is a brutal floral bouquet, abundant with honeyed sweetness and oozing with precious sap. There is a beguiling tartness as Nectary unfurls. A ripe, juicy nuance compliments narcotic blushed petals adding unfiltered naturalness. Nectary is not a preened garden; there is bravado and danger lurking at every twist and turn. To disturb the slumbering flowers would prove perilous. Crude terra cotta vases spill with fruit-baring inflorescences. Cool mineral vapors radiate from ivory walls, incubating delicate seedlings.Nectary is a garden protected by hardy, thorn emblazoned flora, ouch! Rose absolute from Isparta is the sworn protector, shielding injured wood and regal bouquets."," Bramble, Cranberry, Peach, Rose Absolute, Oud, Ambergris, Roseroot, Olibanum, Selfheal, Castoreum, Civet, Labdanum Absolute, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/846005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Salam Eau de Parfum,1881,ANFAS," Salam is a fragrance of serendipitous romance- a gorgeously vivid celebration of chance encounters that lead to love at first sight. Modelled on the concept of two people destined to cross paths, and the scents of the bustling street that leads them unknowingly towards one another, it's a rich, sweet floral oriental that perfectly captures the unmistakable buzz of an instant connection, where every small detail feels like it portends a bright and joyous future.On this picture-perfect street, our future lovers are primed for romance with a delightful montage of scents- the bright, juicy citrus of bergamot and mandarin, layered against the intoxicating beauty of freshly-cut white flowers. A warm, sweet amber heart glows like the midday sunshine, imbuing Salam with a deep sense of calm, as if to reassure us that this meeting was, in fact, meant to be- a sensation only deepened in the final phase of the fragrance, a gently rapturous base of smooth musk and creamy sandalwood that reflects the quiet joy of two souls that have found one another."," Bergamot, mandarin, amber, jasmine, musk, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Allegretto 7.2 Eau de Parfum,1081,Berceuse Parfum," How does melancholy become beautiful? Listen to the stirring, sombre second movement of Beethoven's 7th symphony and imagine how it might smell. Dark, sweeping, poignant: this is Allegretto 7.2.A study in theme and variations, Allegretto is built around Haitian vetiver that brightens and darkens as it develops, layering earthy scents, smoke, and lavender.Allegretto 7.2's notes recede and repeat rhythmically. A fresh mint top note poises in the air like a conductor's baton, soon giving way to swirls of smoke, roots, and moist green leaves. Aromas of fresh-turned earth and wild vegetation join lavender and herbs at the heart. Then, as it falls from its crescendo, Allegretto settles on a warm base of cedar wood, vanilla, and benzoin. With its dynamic, seductive pulse, Allegretto is vetiver transcendent."," vetiver, smoke, lavender, mint, herbs, cedar wood, vanilla, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/845000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Peregrina Extrait de Parfum,2770,Thameen," Even amongst the most famous precious stones in the world, La Peregrina stands out- a perfectly formed pear-shaped pearl, one of the largest in the world, with a stunning legacy that includes King Philip II of Spain, Napoleon III, and, more recently, Elizabeth Taylor. With a backstory like that, any fragrance to use the name had best be something special. Luckily, Peregrina, the newest from Thameen, is more than up to the challenge- a rich, warm blend of lush florals and spicy resins that exudes royal opulence and Old Hollywood glamour with equal abundance. Like its namesake pearl, Peregrina announces itself already fully formed, eschewing a traditional opening in favor of getting right to the rich, luscious heart of alluring myrrh, mouthwatering vanilla and a seductively sweet ylang ylang supplemented by Damascus rose, gardenia, and jasmine. The base takes the aromatic warmth of the scent to the next level, combining a sweet, resinous amber with smooth white musk. The overall effect is complex and extravagant but disarmingly easy to wear, with a perfectly timeless style- in other words, just as elegant and effortless as a perfect pearl."," Rose Damascene, Lily Of The Valley, Gardenia, Jasmin, Vanilla, Amber, Caramel, Myrrh, Ylang Ylang, White Musk, Amber, Poudre",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/734023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cigar Rum Eau de Parfum,1191,Strangers Parfumerie," The name - Cigar Rum – is a bit on the nose. But the scent itself? A surprisingly delicate and detailed piece of work that, while definitely redolent of the rich, dried fruit and tobacco leaves soaking in oak caskets of Caribbean island booze implied in the name, has a lightness to it that makes it a fabulously easy wear. We think that part of what makes Cigar Rum such a great candidate for office wear and daytime is that the layers of balsamic woods, tobacco, and dried fruit are dry and crisp, aerated by a salty note that might be the seaweed absolute. The rum is rich and almost chocolatey in its booziness at first, but this fades quite quickly, leaving a cozy, toasted mÃ©lange of oaky tobacco and dried fruit to linger on the skin. In other words, people will think just that you smell deliciously cozy and ”˜warm', rather than suspecting you've been drinking. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar – and Cigar Rum just smells good."," raisin, dried fruits (prune and cherry), rum absolute, mandarin, amber, tobacco, oakwood, vetiver, resins, labdanum absolute, seaweed absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Peau d'Ambre Eau de Parfum,2471,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Inspired by the stone vases and leather gourds used to transport fragrant resins and scented oils in ancient Corinth, Peau d'Ambre is the latest reminder that Pierre Guillaume is a master of striking skin scents. Utilizing a subtle yet powerful palette of materials that would have been familiar in the 6th century BCE Mediterranean- warm, sweet resin, woodsy, sappy balsam, and smoky, silver frankincense- Guillaume weaves a tapestry of sophisticated, understated heat that radiates off skin without shouting, all atop a base of crystalline amber and aged, hardened leather. While its design is never meant to overwhelm, the resinous warmth is distinctive and long lasting, making it perfect to cut through the winter cold, yet still subtle enough for summer heat- not to mention an ideal candidate to layer balsamic depth beneath any scent of your choosing."," Frankincense, fir balsam, opoponax, benzoin, amber, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34556.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Eau A La Rose Eau de Toilette,1687,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," The beauty of Francis Kurkdjian's A La Rose is beyond reproach. Since its 2014 launch, fragrance lovers worldwide have fallen head over heels for its vibrantly romantic bouquet of French and Bulgarian roses, kissed with a youthful touch of fruit and musk. In fact, it's such an iconic niche scent that any follow-up or flanker would have to be something quite special indeed. Luckily, L'eau A La Rose is a sheer delight- the lush beauty of A La Rose in an eau de toilette of surprising sillage and depth, along with a mouthwatering arrangement of ripe fruits- lychee and pear- that take a timeless classic and make it feel modern, sexy, and fun. Anyone afraid that the rose doesn't stand out as much in EDT form need not worry, either- Kurkdjian nearly doubled the proportion of rose oil in the formula, giving L'eau A La Rose astounding performance for the concentration and more than living up to the lofty standards of the original. Whether you already love A La Rose and are looking for a fresher, brighter companion scent, or if you simply want to expand your collection to include a truly crowd-pleasing floral, you won't want to miss L'eau A La Rose."," Lychee, pear, rose, peony, violet, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49889.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose Prick Eau de Parfum,2457,TOM FORD Private Blend," Flesh. Petals. Thorns.Inspired by Tom Ford's private rose garden, Rose Prick is a wild bouquet of beautiful breeds of rose–Rose de Mai, Turkish and Bulgarian. Sharp and pristine, the piercing prickles of the stems hook onto each other, bonding their blooms in pink perfection. A rose by any other name wouldn't be Tom Ford. What We Think Gently candied with a tingling spice, this delectable rose scent has both a provocative and youthful edge."," Bulgarian rose, turmeric extract, Indonesian patchouli, sichuan pepper, roasted tonka, tolu balsam Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Rose Prick by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

20 20 Eau de Parfum,1274,J.F. Schwarzlose," Berlin, 1920: the global excess of the Roaring Twenties is in full swing. Artists, authors, and youthful revelers delight in the same glamorous parties, social and gender liberation, and hedonistic exuberance capturing the imaginations of New York, London, and Paris. And in the midst of this paradigm-shattering festivity, there was a singular fragrance- CHIC, from J.F. Schwarzlose & SÃ¶hne, a must-have accessory for the fashionable German ""new woman."" 100 years later, as we face a Roaring Twenties of our own, J.F. Schwarzlose has resurrected the spirit of CHIC with 20|20, using detailed analysis of vintage bottles and records to reconstruct and reinvent the historic fragrance as a glamorous and dynamic scent for our own wild times. 2020 is a celebration of craftsmanship and creativity, a romantic tableau where the rich indulgence of pure patchouli meets the cool, velvety freshness of rose essence and bourbon geranium, enveloped in the warmth of sumptuous woody amber notes. The result is vintage floral elegance buoyed by a modern, irreverent buzz of woodsy energy- a fragrance both timeless and contemporary, with an indomitable spirit of creative expression and joie de vivre. It's impossible to say what the next decade may hold, but with 20|20, we can at least ring in the '20s in style."," Rose, benzoin, patchouli, amber woods, pink pepper, geranium",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76909.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Angelys Pear Eau de Toilette,2629,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," For Patricia de Nicolai, nature is the ultimate inspiration. And few fragrances are quite as regal, as inspiring, as downright mouthwatering as the pear. Since its introduction to Europe from Asia during Roman times, this uniquely complex fruit has been treasured, considered a ""fruit of the castle"" and a sign of high social distinction. It's this inspiration, specifically as it relates to the Loire Valley of France, where both delicious pears and great castles abound, that serves as the focus of Angelys Pear, named for both the Loire city of Angers, and the lys, the symbolic flower of French kings.And the scent itself? A divinely sweet and juicy pear note, enhanced by a bouquet of rose and jasmine, highlighted by invigorating oakmoss that suggests a hint of a classical chypre. Ephemeral and serene, full of purity, light, and calm, this eau de toilette perfectly illustrates the fabled bounty of the Loire Valley."," Bergamot, lemon, cut grass, blackcurrant, pear, jasmine, rose, patchouli, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313061.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ligno Extrait de Parfum,1627,Jeroboam," When the devilish patchouli meets the pheromonal grey amber... the result is beyond a perfume, it becomes an alchemists' potion with an aphrodisiacal promise. In Vanina Muracciole's creation, Ligno is a woody extract with Amber at its heart, wrapped by the signature enigmatic musks that gives an unapparelled volume to each Jeroboam perfume."," Bergamot, Sage, Saffron, Cistus , Grey Amber, Fir Balsam, Rose Essence, Tonka Bean, Patchouli, Enigmatic Musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/714011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Unnamed Eau de Parfum,2665,BYREDO," One can't deny that Unnamed got people talking. Not just about this nameless perfume, but about how we all use note lists to help us form an idea of the smell. Let's close our eyes for a moment, breathe it in, and let our nose lead the way...Brrrrrr... cold. We smell the gin-and-tonic snap of juniper berry, and the cold, rooty gleam of orris. The texture is peppery, silvery, and transparent, like a light mist curling around the trees in a Northern fir forest. There is also a mysterious red berry note weaving in and out – an ice-covered raspberry that adds a dollop of deliciousness. Damp lichen and moss add an inky, forest tone to the scent-- creating a gloomy but captivating atmosphere. Only one thing is certain: You get to call this heavenly fragrance any name you wish."," Gin accord, pink pepper, orris root, violet, tree moss, fir balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hongkong Oolong Eau de Parfum,1516,NEZ,"Hongkong Oolong captures the image of China as I see it in a few years, with its contrasts and modernity. This fragrance juxtaposes my interpretation of tea with the specificity of oolong. Designing a fragrance is always about adapting reality. I thought about what it is in tea that gives pleasure and comfort. So, I built the composition around musky notes, which reveal themselves generously, like the long finish you get with a mature tea. Spicy inflections of cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and ginger reproduce the warming effect of a hearty mouthful. A base of sandalwood and tonka bean round off the accord with a milky sweetness. Then, I incorporated the specific characteristics of oolong and that floral lightness; jasmine, honeysuckle, with its fruity and honeyed accents, and a touch of magnolia, which I associate iwth China. Lastly, hints of leather, incense and moss transform the green, vegetal freshness of the tea leaf to bring out its fermented character.","Tea, Oolong, Musk, Spicy, Cinnamon, Cloves, Cardamom, Ginger, Sandalwood, Tonka bean, Sweet, Milky, Jasmine, Honeysuckle, Fruity, Honey, Magnolia",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/770016.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Salted Green Mango Eau de Parfum,1932,Strangers Parfumerie," Salted Green Mango is utterly unique, and dare we say it, one of Strangers Parfumerie's best. There are green fragrances, there are sour fragrances, there are dry fragrances -  Salted Green Mango manages to be all of the above, but with an otherworldly, exotic flair that defies description. Ostensibly an ode to Bao mango, a green, tart mango native to the  Southern part of Thailand, where perfumer Prin Lomros was born and raised, there is nothing really sweet or juicy about the fruit note here. Instead, the mango is a thing of rare, desiccated beauty - a dark green rind dipped in sea salt that sucks all the moisture out of your mouth only to think of it.Why would this be refreshing or appetizing? We don't know, but it just is. Salted Green Mango is a green fruit devoid of sweetness, moisture, or sparkle – instead, it draws us into the shadows of a mineral vetiver and the pleasant bitterness of inedible fruit that is all rind and pith. Salted Green Mango is the crawlspace where we find the coolness and repose we crave in the hottest of weather."," green mango, bitter orange, petitgrain, lime, bergamot, elemi, pineapple, pomelo, star gooseberry, magnolia, rosa damascena, green chili, sandalwood, guava leaf, vetiver, salt accord, seaweed",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
SM Cafe Eau de Parfum,1289,Strangers Parfumerie," SM CafÃ© is half cafÃ©, half sado-masochism. An erotic coffee shop, as perfumer Prin Lomros playfully points out. Yes, it does sound rather dirty ”” but honestly ”” SM CafÃ© is nowhere near as scandalous as it sounds. Put your misgivings to one side, for SM CafÃ© is simply the glorious coming together of a delicious, aromatic fresh-roasted coffee aroma and a smoky boot leather aroma. Think AomassaÃ¯ or Coze (Parfumerie Generale) on steroids. We smell two distinct and entrancing accords here – the first, a pure espresso darkness mingling with a sweet and creamy waffle cone note, which conjures up the realistic aroma of a cafÃ© ambiance, and second, the smoky, woody scent of freshly-waxed leather boots. Naughty or just nice? Wear it and decide for yourself. We think it's one of the all-time coffee greats."," coffee absolute, Russian leather, suede, Javanol, lavender, amber, benzoin, tobacco, cade, Atlas cedarwood, tonka bean, beeswax absolute, maraschino cherry, patchouli, cashmeran, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aroon Sawat Eau de Parfum,2987,Strangers Parfumerie," Aroon Sawat, meaning“good morning!” in Thai, is part of Strangers Parfumerie's 24/7 series. Inspired by the gentle warmth of the morning sun, the scent was composed by perfumer Prin Lomros with the specific intent of capturing all the golden tones implied in the country's original name of Siam, which is thought to have originated in the word Suvannaphumi, meaning Land of Gold.And indeed, Aroon Sawat is a perfume rich in warm, ambered notes that seem to shimmer like particles of gold dust caught in sunlight. Thick, syrupy plums, mango, and ripe passionfruit are suspended in multiple layers of hazy woods, ambers, and resins for a smoky incense effect that lingers all day. Think plumes of rich myrrh and sandalwood incense pouring out of an ancient Thai temple and mingling with the heady scent of ripe stone fruits and white flowers in nearby orchards. Yet, in the midst of all these rich, smoky aromas, there is a thread of freshness – from the citrus, or the sour mango – that cuts through the velveteen texture of the scent and allows air to circulate. It's divine. And if you love woody-ambery-leathery scents such as Costume National or Ombre Indigo (or even Chambre Noir) by Olfactive Studio, then Aroon Sawat could scratch the same itch."," golden mango, Marian plum, pomelo, orange flower, bergamot, passion fruit, tuberose, gardenia, incense, myrrh, rose, amber, sandalwood, mandarin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Burning Ben Eau de Parfum,1554,Strangers Parfumerie," Burning Ben belongs to Prin Lomros' LGBTQ series, and was inspired by a subtle moment in the South Korean movie   ""Burning” where the“Ben” character struggles with a conversation that might be interpreted as homophobic, dredging up a host of complex feelings in himself. Burning Ben is a stunning phenolic scent that similarly unites all sorts of opposing elements – hazelnut, beeswax, burning tires, leather, and forest fruit – creating a surprisingly harmonious and“complete” whole, just like the conflicted humanity of Ben.Burning Ben opens with a hugely realistic shot of espresso, with the dark, roasted flavor of beans brought perhaps a hair too far to burning point. Doused in a black, almost chewy sweet, spicy smoke, it feels like walking through the aftermath of a fire. But fear not, for the smoke clears and lifts in places, revealing intriguing hints of nuts, berries, saffron, and plums, notes that lend the austere smoke a gorgeously toothsome gourmand richness. A caramelized-butter amber, incense, and beeswax tandem shore all of this up from the basenotes, for a complex and rich finish that dawdles pleasurably between sweet, smoky, spicy, and sandalwoody without alighting completely on one or the other. If you love phenolic scents such as The Black Knight by Francesca Bianchi or T-Rex by Zoologist but want something softer and subtler for daytime wear, then Burning Ben could be for you."," hay, plum, espresso, tobacco, hazelnut, leather, patchouli, incense, dark chocolate, tar, castoreum, cognac, labdanum, beeswax, cherry, amber, allspice, Javanol, saffron, burning tire",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cigar Rum Intense Extrait de Parfum,2255,Strangers Parfumerie," If you loved the original Cigar Rum but longed for more heft, more richness....more everything – then the Extrait version, Cigar Rum Intense, is for you. Sculpting the original's bright, punchy booze-and-tobacco into a new and more mature direction, Cigar Rum Intense leans on a dark, resinous coffee absolute, a dash of cinnamon, and a strong  aquatic note to mark itself out as a different animal. Compared to its predecessor, Cigar Rum Intense is altogether a more muscular affair, an injection of briny radiance lifting and hoisting the richly spicy tobacco, booze, and dried fruit accords over the last mile. It lasts forever. Surprisingly, Cigar Rum Intense also smells fresher; a rugged, outdoorsy version of the casual island bar vibe of the original. In the far drydown, a gorgeously silky, masculine-leaning musk emerges, shot thrown by the spicy ”˜bay rum' bitterness of copaiba, a greenish-gold tree resin native to Brazil. While Cigar Rum is for the young buck, let's say that Cigar Rum Intense is for the man (or woman) who has arrived at the top and isn't afraid to signal it."," raisin, coffee, copaiba, cinnamon, dried fruits (prune and cherry), rum absolute, mandarin, amber, tobacco, oakwood, vetiver, resins, labdanum absolute, tea rose, leather, seaweed absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oliver Eau de Parfum,1645,Strangers Parfumerie," Oliver is an original take on the aromatic herbs and citrus freshness of the traditional eau de cologne. At first, you smell the bright, tart (and always oddly dry) burst of citrus notes of the classic Farina or 4177, with their cleansing and pure aroma designed by nature to awaken and refresh the senses, supported by the crisp, herbal undergrowth of basil leaf, clary sage, and cool, green cypresses. But as the more volatile aromatic notes burn off, you notice some subtly non-traditional notes in the background. There is the musky scent of a man's crisp white linen shirt pulled freshly from his warm body, introducing a beautifully intimate and human tone (we suspect the glowy magic of ambrette seed and ambergris to be the responsible parties here). Then there is the exciting tang of sea salt, the dry rosy leather of quince, the incensey bitterness of oakmoss, and the powdered plushness of triple-milled French iris soap. Oliver feels personal. It's far more evolved than it ought to be, for all its eau de cologne inspiration. It makes sense to us that this raspy, oddball freshie was inspired by the bittersweet love story of two young men on the cusp between childhood and adulthood in the acclaimed indie movie Call Me by Your Name."," bitter orange, mojito, grapefruit, bergamot, apricot, quince, petitgrain, mandarin, fig, clary sage, cypress, magnolia, orris concrete, basil, rose de mai, orange flower, pink pepper, coriander, leather, tobacco, ambergris, patchouli, vetiver, ambrette seed, oakmoss, grape leaves, grass, sandalwood, sea salt, linden, mahogany, mastic, olive, clean shirt (blue billowy)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lumberjack Cologne Eau de Parfum,1588,Strangers Parfumerie," Lumberjack Cologne smells exactly as advertized – a bright, herbal eau de cologne-style scent built around the invigorating scent of freshly-felled lumber! Prin pegs the inspiration for this scent as the scent rising from the dampened shirt of a North American lumberjack after a long morning cutting timber. As he mops his sweaty brow, we lean in and inhale the clean, healthy smell of warm skin, sawdust from the great redwoods he has been touching, and the gasoline smell of his saw and other tools. There is a flash of bitter citrus and Scandinavian herbs in the opening, making us think of the simple but timeless eau de cologne such a man might have applied early on that morning before heading to the forest. Lumberjack Cologne just smells great – a spacious, airy woody scent teeming with the aromatic aroma of tree sap, citrus, herbs, fresh air, clean skin, and cut wood. Nothing more, nothing less. Sometimes it makes sense not to over-think the kind of ripped-from-nature smell that makes us happy. And that is what Lumberjack Cologne is."," lemon, bergamot, grapefruit, mandarin, orris butter, guaiacwood, motor oil, soap, cedar, oak, sycamore, leather, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sangre Dulce Eau de Parfum,1343,Strangers Parfumerie," Sangre Dulce is a weird and yet completely wearable gourmand idea born out of Prin Lomros' love for two specific movies. The ”˜sangre' part of the title, meaning blood (or family ties), represents the crazy lifestyle and mores of the strange religious cult in Alejandro Jodorowsky's Santa Sangre, and the ”˜dulce' part (sweet) comes from the lurid hallucinations experienced by party goers upon ingesting a cocktail laced with LSD  in the French movie ""Climax"" by Gaspar NoÃ©. Based on the inspiration, we expect an oddball mixture of sweet and inedible elements that have been thrown together in a somewhat wild and unconventional manner. And that is exactly what we get! A wild pinprick burst of woodland strawberries, technicolor in their juicy sweetness, imploding over and over again in a beescomb, their pulpy scent muffled by a molten pour of pure gold honey. But there is also a softly musky tobacco-ish accord, shot through with rosewater marshmallow fluff, and buttery ylang sharpened to a spike with blood orange. It is both sweet and not sweet, edible and firmly inedible, all at once. The balance here is superb, refining a cornucopia of fruits, burnt sugar, and balsams to a slim and elegant peak that is unusual in the gourmand genre. Consider us astonished and delighted!"," sangria, rose water, strawberry, brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, tobacco, pomegranate, ylang ylang, benzoin, Peru balsam, maple syrup, civet, patchouli, blood orange",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mandarava Extrait de Parfum,2779,Parfum Prissana," Inspired by the vision of sweet yellow flowers, white elephants, and towering mountain peaks that make up the Thai vision of Trayastrimsa – the Buddhist Nirvana or Afterlife - Mandarava is perfumer Prin Lomros' interpretation of what heaven smells like. At first, heaven smells like a lei of heady tropical flowers laid around your neck, the lushness of ripe jasmine, rice pudding-esque champaca, and buttery, banana-rich ylang sending the senses reeling. There is an impression of red fruit swollen with juices, threatening to burst out of the pollen-soaked flowers and run down your arm uninterrupted. But this is no innocent, girlish affair. Mandarava shows us that flowers can be downright filthy when they want to be. The lasciviousness of the Hindi oud couples furiously with a sharp civet and earthy cumin to lend the floral bouquet a spicy animalic edge that seems lifted out of 1980s powerhouse canon, before the reformulation bug bit. Now envisage this dense, spicy floral knot being lifted and diffused by a clean, powdery nag champa musk and soft incense ash, wafting in and out of the animalic floral oud notes to breathe air into the composition. After smelling both Ma Nishtana and Mandarava, we are calling Prin Lomros the Master of the Eastern incense theme in perfumery, hands down."," bodhi tree, borneol, jasmine sambac, Himalayan champaca, Madagascar ylang ylang, Indian marigold, frankincense, myrrh, styrax, rose, lotus, cinnamon, civet, nagamortha, ruh khus, ebony, Mysore sandalwood, Assamese oud (Hindi), Indonesian patchouli, oakmoss, gardenia, coriander, tolu, Siamese benzoin, aldehyde, cumin seed, amber, tuberose, ash",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ma Nishtana Extrait de Parfum,1995,Parfum Prissana," Ma Nishtana are the first two words in a phrase meaning ""Why is tonight different from all other nights?"", taken from the stories and lyrics of Had Gadya (the Chava Alberstein version). In a way, it makes sense to turn this philosophical question on its head and ask,“why is this incense scent different from all other incense scents?”. After all, incense is a crowded genre and it really takes something special to stand out. Well, Ma Nishtana is something special.Standing somewhere between the soaring ethereality of Comme des Garcons' Avignon and the spiced, human weirdness of Grimoire by Anatole LeBreton, Ma Nishtana is unusual for its refusal to commit to either coolness or warmth. Instead, it is both, all at once. Its opening of smoky myrrh exploding in a cloud of fizzy aldehydes feels cooling, but immediately a bold dose of saffron, nutmeg, black pepper, cumin, and cardamom, burning through a cloud of ash and smoke turns, up the heat. There is incense – mixed incense resins rather than any single one – smoldering on a near-by censor, creating an aura of ”˜Buddhist temple'-like mysticism. But there is also the spicy warmth of thickly-fruited tea breads and pain d'epices percolating beneath, filling out the hollows. Austerity balanced by comfort. If you're on an incense quest, then Ma Nishtana might just be your final destination."," saffron, amber, aldehyde, frankincense, myrrh, styrax, rose, nutmeg, pink pepper, caraway, black pepper, cardamom, cumin, labdanum, castoreum, sandalwood, patchouli, smoke, leather, Norlimbanol, clove, allspice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Thichila Eau de Parfum,1938,Parfum Prissana," Thichila is a stunning floriental incense scent, composed in the Eastern style, that will keep you guessing as to whether it is a floral oud, or an oudy floral, or a luscious floral bouquet awash in exotic Thai herbs and spices. Either way, this scent presents an ever-changing picture, like a landscape of red and gold sands shifting in a sandstorm.  The composition of Thichila is a marvel. Although at its core, the scent revolves around a hefty dose of animalic Thai oud dressed up with the minty, camphoraceous freshness of Wan Sao Lhong - a traditional Thai plant that looks like a flower but smells like a herb - Thichila fools us all at first by exploding onto the skin as a bombastic floral. An unctuous combo of champaca flower and Indian tuberose, tangled up in spicy saffron and tangy kaffir lime, creates the phantasm of a jungly ylang ylang. But blink, and before you know it, the floral sweetness is being reined in by a dark and earthy myrrh and roughed up by the leathery funk of that Siam oud. In Thai folklore, Wan Sao Lhong is feted as a love potion. And while Thichila could be a little challenging for oud beginners, one sniff and you will be enchanted – drunk on this Thai love potion."," saffron, borneol, kaffir lime, jasmine sambac, champaca, gardenia, Indian tuberose, myrrh, incense, amber, styrax, rose, turmeric, spikenard, nutmeg, civet, Thai oud, Mysore sandalwood, Indonesian vetiver, cinnamon bark, Wan Sao Lhong ( Amomum Biflorum Jack)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mohragot Eau de Parfum,2019,Parfum Prissana," Mohragot, meaning“emerald” in Thai, is an aromatic, muscular masculine that draws on the classical European fougÃ¨re for structure but twists it in a distinctly Eastern direction for a scent that will surprise and delight even the most jaded of palates. Exotic touches such as earthy betel leaf, milky-green-sweet pandan leaf, and dusty, tobacco-ish chalood bark – all materials indigenous to South East Asian countries such as Thailand and India – make it clear that, although we can smell the inky bitterness of oakmoss and the dark green herbal undergrowth of the classic European forest shifting underneath, we are in unfamiliar territory. And it's a thrilling realization.Thus, in the place of dewy ferns and bright lavender, we smell the damp, reddish soil of the Thai jungle, which mingles with the chewy, green perfumeyness of sweet pandan leaves to create a deeply green, spicy aroma that soothes and excites all at once. In the base, Thai oud joins with a flinty, minty oakmoss and the coumarin-like nuances of chalood bark for a finish that is softly musky and woodsy, gently disengaging the scent from its aromatic topnotes. For those who love the classical fougÃ¨re genre but wish it were a bit more innovative or exotic, Mohragot should be on your test list."," betel leaf, chalood bark, pandan leaf, lime, jasmine sambac, marigold, frangipani, canaga, incense, myrrh, benzoin, clove, rosewood, cinnamon, Thai oud, sandalwood, Thai vetiver, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tiwa Eau de Parfum,1866,Parfum Prissana," Tiwa, Thai for“daytime”, is a radiant floral citrus scent that represents“the scents of home” for perfumer Prin Lomros, conjuring up the aromatic, fresh scent of local herbs being simmered in a pot by neighbors, nearby citrus orchards, and the lingering smoke of precious woods being dried in sheds. Tiwa belongs to the Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, and is thus composed of 100% all-natural raw materials.Tiwa is a beautifully fresh, herbal take on the traditional citrus eau de cologne idea. The herbs in the opening are undeniably exotic, with a mouthwateringly savory, minty Thai basil duking it out with sour kaffir lime, spicy finger root oil, and an earthy green celery seed. The bright, tart citrus notes play second fiddle to the herbs for a while, but eventually jostle their way to the front, for an effect that is akin to Diorella or Eau Sauvage covered in verdant Thai foliage. The herbaciousness dies back eventually to reveal a rich, soapy orange blossom freshness that lingers on the skin for hours, like the warmth of a late afternoon sun. Fresh, tart, and rich, Tiwa is an upgrade on the eau de cologne theme that you'd be crazy to miss out on.Made with 100% Natural materials"," tangerine, kaffir limes, orange flower absolute, petitgrain, holy basil, cananga, finger root oil, Indonesian patchouli, guava leaf, lime, celery seed, vetiver, Australian sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tom Yum Eau de Parfum,1070,Parfum Prissana," Oh boy – just say the word Tom Yum and our mouths water. And the perfume Tom Yum has precisely the same effect. Spritz it on and your senses are instantly afire. Inspired by the famously sweet and sour Tom Yum soup of Thailand, Tom Yum (the scent) belongs to Prissana's Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, meaning that it is all natural – more a recipe than a formula, almost. An extra inducement to lick your own skin when you're wearing it.Tom Yum smells immediately like a steaming hot bowl of Tom Yum. Exploding with bright, citrusy lemongrass and coriander flavors, it is a perfect balance of hot, sweet, sour, and herbal. The flavors seem to go 1,000 leagues deep in each direction. The gingery heat of galangal is cooled by the soapy, lemony grassiness of coriander for a sensory experience that feels invigorating and exciting. Keeping all these explosive herbal and citrus notes in check is a backing of nutty, smoky chalood bark, and a soft sigh's worth of jasmine. Wonderful for a hot summer's day, when a dramatic twist on the traditional eau de cologne-style refreshment is called for.Made with 100% natural materials"," Lime, kaffir lime leaf, lemongrass, petitgrain, jasmine absolute, galangal, coriander, patchouli, grapefruit, lemon, chalood bark",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Natsumeku Eau de Parfum,1443,Parfum Prissana," Natsumeku is the Japanese word for the start of the summer and is inspired by the pleasant memory of a day perfumer Prin Lomros spent wandering around the Japanese countryside on a bright, cloudless spring day. Belonging to the Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, Natsumeku is composed of 100% all-natural raw materials. Natsumeku is pure sunshine in a bottle. Imagine an entire Japanese yuzu tree – the variety of citrus native to Japan – pulped, distilled, and poured into a small clear bottle, and that is what it smells like. The traditional woods of Japan – silvery hinoki wood and green, minty-rosy camphor – form the subtle backing to the main players, which are the stunning liquid sunshine of yuzu (both the peel and the fruit), the dark green leaves clustered around the fruit (neroli), and the bittersweet lime twang of bergamot. Being all natural, this joyful explosion of multi-faceted citrus fruits cannot last forever, but the perfumer has cleverly extended the citrus loveliness as far as he can by way of a classically clean, soapy neroli accord that seems to go on forever.Made with 100% Natural materials"," camphor, yuzu, hinoki, orange bitter, mandarin, lavender, neroli, orris butter, rose otto, oakmoss, artemisia, bergamot, tangerine, palo santo",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Maruyama Eau de Parfum,1211,Parfum Prissana," Maruyama, the name of a Japanese mountain, is a scent inspired by a visit made by perfumer Prin Lomros to a herb and flower garden in Sapporo, Hokkaido Japan, an island famous for its incredible diversity of rare medicinal herbs and flowers native to Japan. Using a natural and rare blue chamomile that tints the liquid an unusual blue hue*, Maruyama belongs to the Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, and is thus composed of 100% all-natural raw materials.Maruyama is a rich, savory-herbal woody scent teeming with the surprising aromas of freshly roast coffee beans, caramelized brown sugar, amber, and celery root – notes that cannot be explained by the notes list. Rather, this is alchemic magic worked by the combination of unusual materials such as lovage root and blue chamomile, herbal notes that have an odd, unexpected richness and dimension to them. Quirky and entrancing, this chorus of ”˜brown', sweetly aromatic notes proves to be robust, lasting throughout the day until the vegetal muskiness of ambrette seed diffuses it all out into a soft, woodsy haze. If you are fond of rich but kind of weird, offbeat herbal or woody perfumes such as Comme des Garcons' Sequoia, then Maruyama is for you.Made with 100% Natural materials*Please note that due to Maruyama's all-natural ingredients, the fragrance may change color to a dark grey/purple. This is perfectly normal and does not affect the scent itself."," chamomile, camphor, artemisia, marjoram, incense, rose otto, angelica, jatamansi, amyris, ambrette seed, cedarwood, vetiver, lovage  root",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
If by RK Eau de Parfum,1321,Frapin," ""If you can keep your head when all about you/ Are losing theirs and blaming it on you...""So begins Rudyard Kipling's legendary poem, which, for all the striking and undeniable faults of the author, has endured to become a paean to lives lived with clear eyes and gusto, lives where, to paraphrase Kipling, Triumph and Disaster are two imposters to be treated just the same. Inspired by his grandfather's spirited retelling of the poem, Frapin artistic director David Frossard was traveling south down the Indian coast when he was struck with the desire to create a scent dedicated to travel, adventure, self-discovery, and constant personal improvement. The scent itself is a dashingly spicy masculine that whisks us across the subcontinent with fiery pepper from Karnataka igniting a heady dose of ginger and cinnamon, before balancing it out with a cool, milky fig. At the intersection of spicy and creamy is the main ingredient, precious sandalwood from Mysore, the finest in the world, which finds robust partners in a base of Indonesian patchouli, Peruvian guaiac, and Venezuelan tonka- a rich, smooth, powerful combination for any man ready to seize his destiny. Make no mistake- Kipling himself was not, by any means, a role model. But If by RK transcends the flaws of the man to capture the core of why his words have remained so firmly etched in the public consciousness for all these years."," Ginger, pepper, bergamot, fig milk, cinnamon, cashmere wood, sandalwood, patchouli, guaiac, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22620.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Musc Moschus Eau De Parfum,2731,Rania J.," What makes a perfect winter musk scent? For us, it's a fragrance that can balance the deep, sensual aspects of musk with its fresher, brighter aspects to create something both comforting and stylish- in other words, a scent that wears as well on a bright, clear winter morning as it does in the middle of a blizzard. And Musc Moschus nails this balancing act perfectly- warm yet bright, sweet yet gentle, it's the kind of effortlessly beautiful musk scent that can take the edge off the chilliest day, but won't overwhelm even when you're right next to the fireplace. The secret is the interplay between the strong, lovely base of white musk- at once both smooth and warm- and a strikingly lovely sweet and fruity opening- tart berries and juicy blackcurrant with just the right touch of sugar to feel festive but fresh. Creamy sandalwood and vanilla enhance the richness of the musk, and a perfect touch of iris adds sophistication and depth. It's the perfect scent to carry you through family gatherings and new-year adventures alike. In fact, there's really only one drawback- like winter itself, Musc Moschus is a limited edition that won't be available once 2020 rolls around, so don't miss your opportunity to get a bottle."," Bergamot, strawberry, blackcurrant, sandalwood, iris, vanilla, cashmeran, white musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
War and Peace II Extrait de Parfum,2135,Areej Le Dore," War and Peace II is an olfactory battle of life and death, where precious aromatics that are complete opposites clash and then infuse into one another, finding balance and harmony.In the opening, the composition explodes with a smoky incense represented by Himalayan fossilized amber resin over 35 million years old. This prehistoric substance was dry distilled, allowing it to break and release its ancient spirit. These deep anddark incensy notes layer with one of the softest aromatics known to man: rose. Leathery, balsamic, slightly piney resin incense lays atop the freshly distilled virgin soul of Indian rose: Ruh Gulab, one of the most precious oils in India. A soft, silky rose cloud, covered in ancient black smoke, a flawless marriage of darkness and light.Powdery and sticky sweet orris root absolute supports the rose, pulling it into the heart, where aged and soothing, chocolaty patchouli awaits. Warm, sensual orris root absolute in combination with Ruh Gulab conveys the feelings of peace and glory, and brings a burst of life into the composition.Suddenly, everything that came before is swallowed by the power of nuclear, natural musks. Thick, dark waves of salty ambergris, furry deer musk and dirty black leather of castoreum, co-extracted all together by Russian Adam, create a sensation of loud, struggling, deadly war. Animalics take over, capturing and captivating everything along the way. Wild, ferocious currents of civet take the invasion to an even deeper level. Wafts of smoky amber return to the scene, coupled with one of the most leathery, dirty vetivers, creating a bold, olfactory drama. And when the spectacular aromatic battle has finally mellowed, dry and heavy animalic leather remains to dominate at the base; intense and regal, smooth and sensual, leather that lasts for hours and hours...Here we have faced a juxtaposition of black and white, of life and death, and through it all, we discover in this calmly aggressive composition a harmonious balance. This olfactory poem, War and Peace, will satisfy even the most adventurous fragrance lover.Version II has been updated with ""more refinement"" to the ingredients and structure of the fragrance specifically the patchouli and orris root","Amber Resin, Smoky Incense, Rose, Leathery, Balsamic, Chocolaty, Patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/784021.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ummo Eau de Parfum,1069,Xinu," Ummo is a tribute to tobacco, one of the most representative and symbolic plants of the American continent. The smoke given off by the dried leaves of tobacco is considered sacred and has been used for spiritual rituals, healing, and purification ceremonies since long before European commodification made the plant synonymous with indulgence and bad habits. It's this older, purer expression of tobacco that makes Ummo such a uniquely potent and spiritual experience- as rich and spicy as any tobacco scent, but with a gorgeously naturalistic green floral character, enhanced with fresh jasmine tobacco flowers and the sweet resinousness of styrax. A warm but bright tonka and cedar base manages to feel both ethereal and comforting, establishing Ummo as a uniquely soulful tobacco scent, and a welcome addition to Xinu's already impressive lineup."," Virginia tobacco, Jasmine tobacco, Styrax, Tonka bean, Juniper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/786005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
What About Pop Eau de Parfum,1394,The House Of Oud," A great gourmand fragrance is meant to stimulate not only your tastebuds, but also your spirit- to provide a wonderful moment stolen away from the demands and burdens of everyday life. And while decadent confections and many-tiered cakes may be the stuff of fairytales, sometimes the most memorable indulgences in real life are as simple as a mouthwatering handful of caramel popcorn. That's the pleasure of What About Pop, a delectable new gourmand built around a perfect note of salted, buttery, caramel-enveloped popcorn. Sweet and savory, this arresting accord is softened with a unique Lunar Flower, enriched with a velvety milk cream, and delicately placed atop a deeply sensual base of woodsy vanilla. It's a gourmand scent as rewardingly unique as it is delicious, a perfect treat for lovers of all sweets, but especially those who find the sweet and salty crunch of caramel corn to be the world's most perfect snack. Take a break from everyday life with What About Pop, and feel your cares melt away."," Salty popcorn, Hawthorn, Caramel, Lunar flower, Milk cream, ExaVanilla, Amber, Ebony, Vetyver, Benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/764027.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dendera Extrait de Parfum,2876,Centauri Perfumes," Dendera is inspired by the great ancient Egyptian civilization and the mystery and immense beauty they left behind. The Dendera complex itself is a unique temple, famous for its“Dendera Lightbulbs” and built upon a much older temple complex newly discovered beneath its floors. The top notes open with rich spices, cinnamon and nutmeg for a  warm and inviting beginning. A resinous natural incense accord built upon frankincense and myrrh continues to entice as the scent starts to dry down. The natural Moroccan orris butter has a dry dusty tonality with a gently sweet Rooibos tea like quality. The combination of the orris with the earthy Vietnamese oud is a beautifully dry and rich accord reminiscent of Egyptian desert sands. As it dries down through the resinous incense base a creamy Indian sandalwood comes through, becoming softly coated in a sparkling fine musky white ambergris, a touch of vanilla adds a hint of sweetness. Designed to be a scent fit for a Pharaoh and inspired by their legacy."," Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Orris Butter, Bulgarian Rose Absolute, Frankincense, Myrrh, Labdanum, East Indian Sandalwood, Vietnamese Oud, Haitian Vetiver, Madagascan Vanilla Absolute & White Ambergris Tincture.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/841000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gaea Eau de Parfum,2413,Centauri Perfumes," Gaea, named after Mother Earth, is a harmony of many elements working together as one, just as the many aspects of nature create an overall unity.The scent starts off amongst a lush forest and opens up with a green leaf accord combined with wormwood that creates a unique and slightly unusual herbal introduction that bringing you right to the edge of the forest. As it starts to progress, the floral notes start to softly emerge. A smooth white tuberose nuanced by rose, lavender and orris starts to come through. A dark honey emerges at the same time coating the florals in a deliciously soft sweetness.The dry down stays close to the skin like a sensual aura of ambrette musk, ambergris, and honey. In the background an earthy patchouli lingers on, reminding you of the forest from where you started the journey."," Green Leaves, Dry Earth, Honey, Tuberose, Rose, Lavender, Orris Butter, Apple, Cedarwood, Wormwood, Patchouli, Ambrette Musk, & Ambergris.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/841001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mile High Eau de Parfum,1936,Parle Moi de Parfum," Immortelle flowers don't get their name by accident- these lusciously sweet-smelling members of the Helichrysum family blossom in places lesser florals fear to tread. It's both their intoxicating aroma and their striking fortitude that inspire Mile High, a dynamic, sexy, modern unisex fragrance dedicated to those who thrive no matter what challenges life has to offer. It's only appropriate that the immortelle absolute that animates the heart of Mile High hails from Corsica, an island renowned for its rugged beauty. Sweet and earthy with a hint of spice, it pairs perfectly with a juicy, sharp, gently smoky pineapple note to create a stunning unisex profile that feels fresh, substantial, and undeniably seductive. Combined with the sensual depth of Venezuelan tonka bean and Indonesian patchouli, and we realize that the other connotation of Mile High hasn't been lost on Parle Moi- this is seriously sexy stuff. Like the immortelle itself, we suspect Mile High is going to be thriving for years to come.Mile High is an exclusive creation for Luckyscent & Scent Bar."," Immortelle, tonka, patchouli, pineapple",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76714.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Telegrama Eau de Parfum,1724,Imaginary Authors," Aboard a transatlantic flight many years after an intense but short-lived meeting, two Argentinean lovers are serendipitously united- but the repercussions of this much-anticipated convergence could have global consequences.Inspired by the glamour of first class in the golden age of air travel, Telegrama is a stylishly comfortable, seductively refined fragrance that has us yearning for the good old days. Presented in the style of classic masculine scents of the '60s, it's a plush, clean, retro-cool fragrance so comfortable and easy to wear that it just may become your new daily go-to. The opening is instantly enchanting, with the classically sharp tone of lavender enhanced with fiery black pepper and smooth talc, before leading into a warm heart of polished woods that evokes the opulently appointed cabins of a luxurious mid-century aircraft. And to complete the illusion, a smooth, comfortable base of powdery vanilla and fresh linen lends a deft richness, complex but appropriately light for a fragrance inspired by air travel. It's a classic but refreshing scent, universally wearable despite the masculine inspiration, and simply, inarguably, well, good. Try it today and make a connection of your very own."," Talc, lavender, black pepper, teak, amyris, vanilla powder, fresh linen",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77519.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Koiame Eau de Parfum,1814,J-Scent," With a motif of ""rain, "" this scent evokes loving memories carved into the heart. The top note is a faint aroma of mandarin and cassis that mimics the scent of petrichor that precedes the rain. A heart of whispering violet and magnolia evokes the subtle way that rainfall quietly awakens the outside world. Finally,  in the mossy,  musky base,  we feel the soft and comforting joy one can find in a rainbow,  shimmering in the sky as the clouds part."," Apple, peach, bergamot, mandarin, lemon, cassis, green notes, rose, jasmine, magnolia, violet, water lily, musk, cedar, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/814017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hakka Eau de Parfum,1589,J-Scent," A delicate and refreshing scent that wears crisp and gentle. Hakka opens with cool, transparent mint (the menthol infusing your skin with a noticeable cooling effect), before introducing the subtly sweet aroma of jasmine and lilies.

Divine Vanille Eau de Parfum,1709,Essential Parfums," When you have a raw material as glorious as vanilla absolute from Madagascar, the smart thing to do is to let it shine. And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme – addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.This clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers – the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity. Divine Vanille is mysterious, yet easy to read - the perfect balance between simple and complex."," Clary sage, cinnamon, black pepper, osmanthus, incense, pomarose, vanilla, tonka, benzoin, cedar, musk, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Acqua di Scandola Eau de Parfum,2135,Parfum d'Empire," Every single molecule in Acqua di Scandola reflects Marc-Antoine Corticchiato's love for Corsica and its wild, windswept beauty. Inspired by the eponymous Scandola, a tiny rocky outcrop of an island just off the Corsican coastline that can only be accessed by the sea, Acqua di Scandola is an unusual aquatic for two reasons. First, it conjures the natural scent of sea air without losing ground to the sweet, melony aromachemicals that ruin other aquatics. Second, Acqua di Scandola encapsulates not only the sea surrounding the island, but also the wild herbs, algae, aromatics, and grasses that cling to the rocks of the island itself.   We don't see it listed in the notes, but we smell a lot of citrus in the opening. In fact, it's as if Marc-Antoine Corticchiato borrowed the thrillingly bitter orange note from Azemour Les Orangers or the yuzu from Yuzu Fou, rubbed enough sea salt into its peel to make it crackle, and simply set it into a bed of algae, moss, and lichen. This citrus-in-a-sea-breeze accord is both natural-smelling and durable, occupying most of the scent's trajectory from top to bottom. But in the background, a textured mÃ©lange of garrigue herbs and grasses adds subtle warmth that reminds us of salt-kissed skin, hay, and minerals evaporating under the sun. Incredibly invigorating and lung-expanding, Acqua di Scandola is the rare aquatic that will really make you feel like you're on or near the sea itself, rather than in a chemical-driven fantasy of the real thing."," algae extract, juniper, immortelle, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35719.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bee Extrait de Parfum,1306,Zoologist," We don't usually play favorites. We love all of our perfumes, and their creators, equally. Trust us, we really do. But when a perfume comes along that's such a unanimous hit with Luckyscent staff, then we feel obliged to mention it. Bee is just irresistible! Opening with a luscious, jellied orange and a smattering of meadow flowers, the honey accord is both extremely realistic and un-animalic – a rare feat that makes Bee a real contender for the title of the baby bear's porridge of the honey fragrance genre. Set deep in a bombastic surround system of glittering amber and incense, the quietly golden floral honey center is magnified and broadcast until it fills the room, creating an incredible sillage that trails after you like the waves made by the Titanic. Though enormously rich and deep, the honey draws upon a doughy beeswax note to muffle its sweetness, and a softly musky, woody base of sandalwood and benzoin to keep it from sliding off into honey's more animalic facets. Honey is such a difficult note to do well – and, in our opinion, Bee is an unmitigated triumph. If you love, the honeyed, ambery warmth of scents such as Botrytis (but could do without the booze and grape must), then this gorgeous scent by Zoologist could be the Bee in your bonnet (sorry)."," orange, ginger syrup, royal jelly accord, broom, heliotrope, mimosa, orange flower, benzoin, labdanum, musks, sandalwood, tonka, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76026.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Majaina Sin Eau de Parfum,1799,The Different Company," Rich, sweet, and deeply comforting, Majaina Sin proves that The Different Company can do indulgence with every bit as much panache as they famously do freshness. Constructed around a prized specimen of Bourbon Vanilla from Madagascar named Vanilla Gold Extract for its sophisticated and smooth nuance (the product of painstaking hand pollination and careful aging), its intoxicating blend of spicy, sweet, and creamy notes is sure to seduce and delight in equal measure. As a tribute to the unspoiled beauty of Madagascar, Majaina Sin doesn't stop at the vanilla, as the strikingly fiery supporting notes of ginger and cinnamon are also harvested from the island, infusing the smooth, sweet white floral heart with a jolt of passion and energy that balance the mouthwatering sugared orange, chestnut cream, and maple syrup. The result is a scent that truly has something for everyone, an oriental gourmand that won't leave fans of either style wanting. Take a journey to Madagascar with Majaina Sin- we don't blame you if you never want to come back."," Candied orange, bigarade, bergamot, neroli, orange blossom, ginger, heliotrope, orchid, chestnut cream, cinnamon, maple syrup, tonka, amber, sandalwood, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25343.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mxxx. Extrait de Parfum,2781,ERIS Parfums," If the ”˜x' in ERIS Parfums' genderfluid fragrance Mx. marked the freedom to be who you want to be,  the ”˜triple x' of Mxxx. extends that invitation with the lights turned down low ”” and the animalic growl turned up.Mxxx. is Extra.

At once sweet,  earthy,  marine,  and animalic,  natural Ambergris imparts a subtle but unmistakable glow to any elixir it joins,  adding an ineffable warmth,  coziness,  roundness,  and sensuality that you have to smell ”” and feel ”” to understand.ERIS partnered with independent haute perfumery lab L'Atelier FranÃ§ais des MatiÃ¨res (”œAFDM, ” The French Atelier of Materials),  benefiting from its expertise in sourcing,  novel“green” extraction techniques,  and painstaking care in aging and tincturing luxury ingredients such as Ambergris.Mxxx.'s exclusive Cacao from Trinidad and Tobago,  selected by both perfumer Antoine Lie and a French artisanal chocolatier for its dark,  spicy character,  was processed with its cocoa butter intact. This choice,  along with the use of a green,  organic solvent and AFDM's ultrasound technology extraction at a low temperature,  results in a Cacao with its full spectrum of aromatic molecules.Due to its rare ingredients and artisanal production methods,   Mxxx.

Meraki Eau de Parfum,2615,Fort & Manle," Meraki is a dark homage to one of the most infamous fragrances of all time, Shisedo's long discontinued Nombre Noir. Envisioned as the Japanese brand's breakthrough ""western fragrance"" under the direction of the legendary Serge Lutens, the scent was plagued with cost overruns, packaging complications, and ultimately a run of defective flacons that led to Shisedo pulling the plug and destroying their entire unsold stock. But a few bottles are still out there, and the osmanthus-heavy scent itself, shrouded as it is in speculation and mystery, has been praised by none other than Luca Turin as ""an epiphany"" and ""the perfect discontinued scent.""When creating Meraki, Rasei Fort certainly wasn't attempting to recreate the scent of Nombre Noir, which he owns but has never dared to open. However, based on the notes, he endeavoured to create a vintage-inspired white floral heavily based around the delicate Osmanthus flower that is somewhat synonymous with the original. It's a tribute to what Nombre Noir represents- the passion and sacrifices made by perfumers and their unrelenting fervour to create fragrances that are individualistic and unique.And so this is the journey to Meraki, a gorgeous, sumptuous blend of sparkling aldehydes, mouthwatering fruit, and delicately lush, exquisite florals. Equal parts vintage and couture in that inimitable Fort & Manle house style, it's a scent both ravishingly seductive and disarmingly wearable, a creation all its own but with its compelling influences on its sleeve. It's a perfect Rasei Fort creation, in other words. And given its extremely limited availability- only 300 bottles (packaged in exquisite wooden boxes) available worldwide, ever- we think it's a worthy successor to Nombre Noir in every way."," Aldehydes, bergamot, apricot, ambergris, peach, coriander, rose, osmanthus, honey, jasmine, cedarwood, musk, sandalwood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78120.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis Eau de Parfum,1806,Ex Nihilo," Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis is the result of a special collaboration between Ex Nihilo Paris and the French-born visual artist Reine Paradis, who creates narrative photographs and paintings staging herself as the central figure in a transcendent landscape. Reine's work is characterized by abstract swatches of sea blues, greens, and lush tropical colors that plunge the viewer into a semi dream-like state – and this aesthetic has spilled over wholesale into Reine's gorgeous ”˜edit' of Lust in Paradise.Thus, if the original Lust in Paradise is a voyage to the French Riviera by way of a blissful dream, Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis is a journey to California by way of a Gaugin-esque painting of Tahiti. The original scent's pretty white peony and dewy, fruity lychee gains a new solar dimension by way of the addition of salty, woody ambergris note that creates the impression of sun-warmed skin. Giving the fruit, pink pepper, and pretty florals of the original an expansive, glittering radiance, the ambergris slowly melts down into a sultry woody base that – thanks to the woody-spicy molecule known as Georgywood – adds an even more substantial depth to the original's musky basenotes. Just as pretty and sparkling as the original, Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis adds a special something that makes us dream of far-off islands, hypnotic seascapes, sun-drenched skin, and the laid-back feel of Californian artist colonies in California."," pink pepper, white peony, lychee, solar accord, white cedarwood, musk, amber, Georgywood, ambergris accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/720057.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Copper Eau de Parfum,2460,Comme des Garcons," Fiery red metal, yet cool to the touch. The clarity of contrast. The newest from CDG is a provocative olfactive exploration of perceived differences and harmonious alignment built around another everyday material worthy of re-evaluation: copper. In their inimitable, iconoclastic style, the specifics of copper- the shine, the pliability, the literal electricity- are captured with unique notes- luminous pink pepper berries and juicy blackcurrant settle atop intensely green galbanum and sharp violet leaf, fiery ginger and warm, sweet tobacco clash delightfully against a metallic accord, which itself settles in next to warm, resinous myrrh and smooth vanilla. Is this a photo-perfect capture of the actual smell of copper? Why would it be? Rather, this is the soul of copper, cool but conductive, presented for those with the distinctive style to resonate at the same frequency. Another modern masterpiece from Comme des Garcons."," Pink pepper, galbanum, blackcurrant, ginger, violet leaf, tobacco, metallic notes, amber, vanilla, myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/216001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gold Extrait de Parfum,2188,Puredistance," Elegant, chic, unforgettable- the latest Master Perfume from Puredistance is more than worthy of the name Gold. Inspired by a Mondrian-themed Gold, Black and White color palette meant to naturally harmonize with any surrounding, this fragrance finds creator Antoine Lie drawing on a rich trove of golden shaded fragrant materials to create a scent of warm, woodsy elegance- an oriental fragrance with impeccable balance, vintage flair, and a touch of modern chic. Gold opens with invigorating freshness, as juicy green mandarin finds a fiery companion in a bouquet of pink pepper, sweet clove, and aromatic rosemary. A complex heart of florals and even more spices soon follows, the lushness of jasmine absolute charged with a sensual flow of exotic resins and spicy cinnamon that lead into the dreamlike, romantic base of vanilla, tonka, castoreum and myrrh. At Puredistance's indulgent 36% extrait concentration, the scent becomes a veritable feast of the rarest and most precious natural ingredients."," Green Mandarin, Bergamot, Pink peppercorn, Rosemary, Clove buds, Jasmin Absolute, Ciste Absolute, Geranium, Cinnamon, Styrax, Benzoin, Myrrhe, Patchouli, Vanilla Green Beans, Tonka Beans, Castoreum Absolute, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/530023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Atlas Fever Eau de Parfum,1317,Ex Nihilo," Inspired by the intoxicatingly woody, incensey scent of the greatest vintage rosewood guitars in history, Atlas Fever combines French niche perfumery know-how with the devil-may-care spirit of rebellion that defines rock n' roll. Its name – a clever twist on the name of its key raw material, Atlas Cedar – is a clue: this scent is not a collection of plain, inert wood but a scent buzzing with a sense of frenetic, barely-contained energy. The opening is fiery and smoldering, a tinder-box cedarwood charged and shot into the air with a burst of hot pink pepper and incense. Incredibly radiant, the oaky tones of the cedar and the smoky-bitter nuances of the gaiac accord billow around the wearer in a thick, spicy brown cloud for a while, before mellowing out into an incredibly lush, creamy surround sound system of real sandalwood, almondy tonka bean, and earthy black vanilla pod. If you love the potently-balsamic, ambery-woody orientals of recent years such as Armani PrivÃ© Myrrhe ImpÃ©riale or Guerlain's Songe d'un Bois en EtÃ©, then you'll love Atlas Fever. Wearing this, there's no doubt you'll make an impression, even surrounded by hundreds of other people at a rock concert."," Pink pepper, incense, narcissus, cedarwood, sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla, woody accord (gaiac, oakwood)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72055.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Hedonist Absolute Eau de Parfum,2160,Viktoria Minya," One of the most sensuous and beloved niche scents of all time is reborn in the form of an Absolute of rare character. The exhilarating scent of Hedonist Absolute derives its magic from the heady aroma of rich, boozy Jamaican rum blended with lush jasmine and smooth, creamy orange flower. Smoky notes of birch and robustly sweet tobacco couple with lush vanilla to further enhance the depth and mystique of this enchanting creation, still every bit the head-turned as its EDP predecessor, yet rebalanced towards the warmest, richest elements in a way that accentuates its impressive potency and pushes it into impressively unisex territory for men who appreciate the power of sweet, boozy tobacco scent- of course, it's still devastatingly seductive on a woman, as well. Hedonist Absolute is presented within a beautifully crafted bottle filled with highly concentrated eau de parfum. The bottle itself is enclosed within a handmade wooden box fashioned to capture the sleek look and feel of snakeskin leather."," Jamaican rum, jasmine, orange flower, birch, tobacco, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/624006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hedonist Iris Absolute Eau de Parfum,1408,Viktoria Minya," Reborn as an absolute of unrivalled power and sophistication, Hedonist Iris is a truly one of a kind presentation of this treasured and complex floral. This is an intensely opulent iris, enriched with a touch of sensual suede and leather, all of which comes together beautifully with the warmth of cocoa beans and the classic decadence of ripe vanilla. Light ambery notes and the finest woods bring further depth to this boldly seductive scent, creating an elegant, exquisitely bewitching result.Hedonist Iris Absolute is presented within a beautifully crafted bottle filled with highly concentrated eau de parfum.

Hedonist Rose Absolute Eau de Parfum,1490,Viktoria Minya," Hedonist Rose returns in a new and unforgettable form- a scent that strengthens and accentuates the woodsy mysteries of the original for a divine dance between some of the most extravagant ingredients in the world. The lush, romantic power of Turkish rose is still the star player, but now it's complemented with a rare and mysterious oud, smoky, rich, and carnal. Animalic, ambery notes and luxurious sandalwood support the base of this intoxicating oriental, identifying Hedonist Rose as a fragrance of refined quality, but also of carefully restrained seductive power. Presented within a beautifully crafted bottle filled with highly concentrated eau de parfum.

Patchouli in Perfumery Magazine,1939,NEZ," Once seen as a scent favored by courtesans and hippies, patchouli has become a key ingredient in today's perfumery.

Le Pavillon d'Or Eau de Parfum,1358,Dusita," Le Pavillon D'Or by Parfums Dusita was inspired by three different lakes that bear special meaning for Thai-born perfumer, Pissara Umavijani. First and foremost, it draws on the Sun Moon lake in Taiwan, where her father, the poet Montri Umavijani (1941-2006), wrote“A Wish”, a poem that reads:“Will I ever have a chance/to sleep by the River of Love/look on the mountain of Long Life/and dip my vision in Sun Moon Lake/to be able to live more happily/in just any confinement”. But Pissara was also inspired by her love for GuerlÃ©dan Lake in Brittany, a place where she has vacationed in utter tranquility and quiet, as well as the Aisawan Triphya-Art pavilion in Thailand, a stupendous piece of Thai architecture that seems to float weightlessly several feet over the waters of the palace lake. Regardless of geography, however, it is the sense of calm, emotive beauty common to all lakes that pervades the bones of Le Pavillon d'Or. Le Pavillon d'Or is constructed as intricately as a Thai floating pavilion itself. Opening with the crisp, green chill of orris root and mint, the perfume feels immediately cooling; a hot brow soothed by splashes from a mountain stream. The peppery, citrusy nuances of the wild mentha citrata give the opening a fresh, almost classical feel. Soon after, an astonishing fig leaf accord moves into place, managing somehow to be both juicy and dry at the same time. Notes of sweet honeysuckle, boronia, white thyme, and Somalian frankincense render the fig leaf far more interesting than it oughtta be, with tendrils of sweet florals, smoky, and resinous herbal accents creating a heady-but-light whorl of scent. Underneath this all, a divine sandalwood dressed up with a complex, 30-note heliotrope accord give the scent a luxuriantly creamy, almondy base to bed it all down. Both aromatic and warm, Le Pavillon d'Or is a clever series of contrasts wrapped up in a bottle. We think it's as delicately beautiful as the trio of lakes that inspired it."," Mint, honeysuckle, orris, boronia, thyme, olibanum, heliotrope, fig leaf, oak, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Les Annees 25 Bis Eau de Parfum,1244,Tauer Perfumes," Les Annees 25 Bis is an exuberant throwback to what Andy Tauer refers to as the golden age of perfumery- 1920's Europe. During the so-called ""Anees Folles"", jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined the modern woman, and Art Deco peaked- and every bit of that stylish, sexy, iconoclastic energy is captured in Les Annees 25 Bis, a fragrance in grand style, uncompromisingly vintage chic, and yet alluringly modern.Les Annees 25 Bis opens with a fresh citrus and fruit blast, combining the blinding brightness of bergamot and lemon with a mouthwatering peach accord and the intoxicating syrupiness of sweet orange oil. A glamorous heart finds lush natural rose absolute and ylang-ylang essential oil meeting a vibrant iris root, whose earthy depth steers the scent back into unisex territory. It also prepares the ground for a complex, luxurious base- benzoin, patchouli, sandalwood, ambergris, musks, and vanilla which melt together into a rich, exquisite, and long-lasting skin scent that boasts a vintage purr but a modern panache."," Bergamot, lemon, orange, peach, rose, iris, ylang, benzoin, vetiver, patchouli, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31470.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Odeur Du Theatre Du Chatelet Acte 1 Eau de Toilette,1384,Comme des Garcons," Inspired by the history of the theatre mixed with the modernity of its new creative director Ruth Mackenzie. In other words, past and future have an olfactory dialogue on the velvet seats of the Parisian landmark in the tradition of Comme des GarÃ§ons anti-perfumes. The results are subtle and affecting- the energetic hum of black pepper and coffee like an orchestra tuning up, the smooth ambrette and orange blossom the buzz of the crowd, rich orris and sharp rose oxide the warm stage lights, and a deep and gently woodsy base the long lasting final applause. Make no mistake, Odeur Du Theatre Du Chatelet is among CDG's most subtle and avant garde scents thus far. But hidden within that subtlety is a fragrance of great personality and depth- a true tribute to pushing boundaries and creating art."," Ambrette, black pepper, rose oxide, coffee, orange blossom, orris, cashmeran, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/216000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Zdravetz Eau de Parfum,2568,Bruno Fazzolari," Woody, spicy, and herbaceous, the zdravetz herb which grows wild in Bulgaria has a reputation as a potent medicine- the word itself literally means ""health"" in Bulgarian. So we're not quite revealing a big secret to let you know that Zdravetz is an invigorating delight, a collection of juicy fruits, zesty citrus, lush florals, and fresh herbs that combine to inspire a delightful, indelible vitality. Grapefruit fizzes and pops, bright green galbanum hums with natural energy, and mouthwatering passionfruit combines with lush rose to seduce and enchant. Ultimately, the titular zdravetz weaves it all together in wild, woodsy, aromatic harmony. Wholly unique but wonderfully easy to wear, Zdravetz is a fresh-scent lover's dream."," Grapefruit, bergamot, galbanum, rose, passionfruit, cedar, leather, vanilla, zdravetz herb.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69315.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Corpse Reviver Eau de Parfum,1313,Bruno Fazzolari," In 2016, Bruno Fazzolari and Bogue's Antonio Gardoni released Cadavre Exquis, a playful and exuberant kinda gourmand scent created across two continents through a sort of olfactory game of telephone. Featuring a striking dark chocolate note atop vintage-feeling aromatic florals, boozy fruit, and a potent dose of animalics, it was a monster of a scent- one that challenged- and rewarded- those off-kilter enough to get on its level. Now, with Corpse Reviver, Bruno Fazzolari has brought the spirit of Cadavre Exquis back to the mortal plane, but with a bit of rebalancing meant to let the disparate elements play nice together. And we must confess, it works perfectly- now, the rich, earthy indulgence of the dark chocolate springs more naturally from the juicy, boozy opening, while the animalics and spicy florals recede slightly in favor of the aromatics, allowing the composition to breathe and evolve. In the mood for a wholly unique, sophisticated gourmand with real artistic flair? Don't miss Corpse Reviver."," Blood orange, camphor, whiskey, rosemary, marigold, dried fruit, anise, cypress, dark chocolate, vanilla, civet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69316.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Elysium Parfum Cologne,1743,Roja Parfums," Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is the original Elysium extrait in a linen summer suit, an eau de cologne-soaked kerchief tucked into the shirt pocket. Forming part of Roja Dove's ""Parfum Cologne"" collection - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne - Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is pure summer bliss in a bottle, bathing the wearer in a cloud of sparkling, sun-lit citrus and vetiver that lasts all day long.  The original's topsy-turvy structure of balmy musks followed by fresh fruit has been inverted here; in the Parfum Cologne iteration, the joyful opening volley of grapefruit, bergamot, and lime is followed by a scintillating vetiver that sparkles as brightly as the citrus fruits. Joined by the aromatic gin-and-tonic notes of juniper berry and lemon peel, this smells like the first (and best) sip of a cold drink on a wearyingly hot day. The fruitiness of the apple and blackcurrant heart notes is toned down slightly in the Cologne concentration, relying on a slightly drier combination of citrusy vetiver and airy musks to keep the scent buoyant. Towards the end, a balmy but decidedly light creaminess creeps in, the happy result of benzoin and vanilla mingling with the airy cloud of musks and ambergris - yet Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne never loses its crisp zestiness. This Parfum Cologne edition is emphatically its own creature while retaining all the smooth luxuriousness that made the original extrait so special. If you'd like Aventus without the smoky pineapple or a more polished, rounder Bleu de Chanel, then step into the glorious Elysian Fields that is the Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne experience."," lemon, bergamot, litsea cubeba, rose de mai, jasmin de Grasse, cistus, galbanum, celery seed, pink pepper, caraway, nutmeg, pepper, oakmoss, vetiver, cedarwood, cedar needles, guaiac wood, amyris, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Creation-E Parfum Cologne,2178,Roja Parfums," Roja's much loved Creation-E, or Enigma as it's known over the pond, is probably the ne-plus-ultra of private men's club genre - a heady swirl of cognac, rum, cane sugar, cigar tobacco, vanilla, and gingery aromas that wraps around its wearer like an ermine cloak custom-made in one of London's Saville Row tailors. But maybe – just maybe – you can't wear an ermine cloak of a scent every day (though Roja would probably argue with us on that one). If you love the rich warmth of this spicy oriental and just don't know how to quit it, then take heart – Roja Dove has heard you. Creation-E Parfum Cologne is a much lighter, fresher take on the original eau de parfum that's perfect for both those early office meetings and stupid hot weather.  The warm booziness of cognac and rum is still there, but cast over a frame that features lighter, fresher qualities of woods, tobacco, and jasmine, you get less of that ”˜rum-and-coke' feel that's not really appropriate outside of date night or deep winter, and more of a lightly-spiced, powdered tobacco affair. You still get all the complexity of the jasmine layered with woods, spice, leather, and woods, but Creation-E Parfum Cologne is an airy genoise to the fruitcake of the original. Both iterations are gorgeous, so choose according to your own lifestyle and personality!"," bergamot, geranium, rose de mai, neroli, jasmin de Grasse, heliotrope, cardamom, ginger, pepper, patchouli, cognac, tobacco, sandalwood, benzoin, vanilla, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Danger Parfum Cologne,2793,Roja Parfums," A super-complex, aromatic barbershop fougÃ¨re with a classically masculine ballast of cedarwood, patchouli, and oakmoss in the background for support, Danger Pour Homme eau de parfum is now translated into a lighter, fresher form via Roja Dove's  ""Parfum Cologne"" collection - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne. Danger Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is as deeply aromatic and savory-herbal-soapy as its predecessor, but to our noses, the new Parfum Cologne iteration replaces much of the eau de parfum's earthy moss and patchouli basenotes with a beautifully hazy, diffuse cedarwood blown out into a radiant cloud of ambergris and musk. This alteration turns the classic, mature tailoring of the eau de parfum into something altogether younger and more sensual. Certainly, we find the combination of the tart aromatics – lavender, tarragon, and bergamot – and the creamy musks, tonka bean, and cedarwood to be surprisingly sexy. Danger Pour Homme Parfum Cologne retains the impeccable bone structure of the original but loosens the knot of its tie to expose an inviting glimpse of warm, tanned flesh."," lemon, bergamot, lavender, tarragon, lily of the valley, jasmin de Grasse, violet, rhubarb, galbanum, clove, cumin, patchouli, oakmoss, wood notes, vetiver, cedarwood, vanilla, tonka bean, leather, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748054.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Scandal Parfum Cologne,2948,Roja Parfums," If the original Scandal pour Homme eau de parfum is an aromatic fougÃ¨re on steroids (think Eau Sauvage to the nth degree), then the Parfum Cologne version is a lighter, more relaxed take. Through still incredibly masculine and classic-smelling, the additional space and air introduced into the structure allows us to smell all of the aromatic notes more clearly and separately – the spearmint smells freshly-plucked, the stalky rhubarb note more distinct, and the petitgrain even more searingly bitter. The original extrait's coumarin-rich finish has been lightened in the Parfum Cologne iteration so that the herbal tarragon and moss notes get to sing out their forest-green song for much longer, and we notice that the drydown is also fresher, with the sweeter tonka and labdanum notes dialed back in favor of the salty ambergris and radiant musks.  But make no bones about it – the brighter ”˜cologne'-like freshness does not mean a drop in performance metrics. Operating at an eau de parfum concentration of 20%, Scandal pour Homme Parfum Cologne is still a rich, solidly classical fougÃ¨re that will keep you smelling like a Belgravia Square gentleman through to the end of the day. If you love the minty, herbal freshness of traditional barbershop scents and deplore the sweetness of modern masculines, then you'll love Scandal pour Homme Parfum Cologne's return to form."," lemon, bergamot, petitgrain, spearmint, lavender, basil, tarragon, lily of the valley, rose de mai, jasmin de Grasse, violet, rhubarb, cardamom, clove, nutmeg, moss, patchouli, vetiver, cedarwood, casmir wood, sandalwood, tonka bean, labdanum, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748055.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vetiver Parfum Cologne,2892,Roja Parfums," With its new iteration as a Parfum Cologne - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne – Roja once again proves that there's nothing on the market today that comes close to the sheer purity and quality of his Vetiver par excellence. Indeed, we're rather relieved to report that this iteration of Vetiver is very close in character to the genre-defining eau de parfum, especially in its focus on the bright, sparkling qualities of vetiver over its oft-times danker, rootier aspects. But Vetiver Parfum Cologne is indubitably lighter and fresher in feel. Its exquisite balance of woods, citrus, and grassy-nutty vetiver is borne aloft on a raft of expansively radiant musks and cedarwood and its lemongrass-y litsea cubeba is even more foot-forward than in the eau de parfum. Let's call it the summer-weight twin of the original, with a slightly cooler tone overall. Choose according to preference in weight, warmth, and density. Or maybe don't choose at all -  get both and have your vetiver needs covered in one neat (and impossibly elegant) package! In other words, worry not. What we love the most about Roja's vetiver – its brightness, its smooth-as-silk texture, its wholesome nuttiness, and its lack of discordant bitterness or dankness – has been transposed wholesale here into the Parfum Cologne."," lemon, bergamot, litsea cubeba, rose de mai, jasmin de Grasse, cistus, galbanum, celery seed, pink pepper, caraway, nutmeg, pepper, oakmoss, vetiver, cedarwood, cedar needles, guaiac wood, amyris, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748056.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
La Capitale Parfum,2217,Xerjoff," Refined and robust, La Capitale is a testament to Moscow in all of its glorious contradictions- the grandeur and grime, the charm and the chaos, the history and hipness- a true international metropolis. Any fragrance to do justice to this fascinating city must, of course, be as larger than life as the city itself, and so La Capitale bursts forth from the skin, a fruity, spicy, luscious, indulgent fragrance full of joy, zest, and the indomitable Russian spirit. On first spray, La Capitale is an explosively fruity, mouthwateringly sweet affair- caramel-dipped strawberries drip with sugared indulgence, while a juicy peach adds quenching refreshment. The heart of the fragrance ushers in a sophisticated and luxurious floral leather, reinforced with resinous labdanum, lush rose, and a beguilingly spicy blend of saffron and ginger. It all rests atop a wonderfully Xerjoff base of benzoin, amber, and vanilla, smooth, rich, and delectable. Powerful, complex, and undeniably compelling, La Capitale is a fitting tribute to the glorious sophistication of Moscow."," Strawberry, caramel, peach, labdanum, leather, saffron, ginger, rose, amber, benzoin, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51152.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
SpeM PetraM Eau de Parfum,2701,Olivier Durbano," ""Spem Petram,  "" which translates to ""Stone of Hope,  "" is a deeply personal fragrance for Olivier Durbano,   one that finds his religious,   spiritual,   and artistic impulses overlapping to create a deeply resonant,   biblically-inspired (the capital M's are a nod to Mary Magdalene,   who in French religious lore lived out her life in the forests of Southern France) scent of dark wood,   spicy resin,   and incense. At its core is a unique ingredient oft-referenced in the good book- nard,   an aromatic central Asian plant related to valerian root with a distinctively earthy,   salty,   mineralic quality. It's the perfect bridge between the other ingredients- smoky olibanum,   fiery cinnamon and saffron,   sharp,   bright fir,   and rich woods,   everything combining to build to an ecstatic crescendo tempered with an unexpectedly lush rose note. Together,   it creates a powerful sense of exotic spirituality- potent,   warm,   and soothing,   but with an otherworldly characteristic that never becomes overly familiar."," Olibanum, cinnamon, bay leaf, saffron, fir balsam, cabreuva, rose, nard, musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36917.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Maximus Autumn 19 Extrait de Parfum,1098,Bortnikoff," What is real exoticism? This is something that you just couldn't try before. Today many people know what Oud is. But only a few know how rich and unusual can be the character of the wild Oud, fully revealed in a masterfully created blend. In Oud Maximus the concentration of Oud oils is so high that to preserve other notes, a special technique was created for mixing the Laotian, Indian and Thai Oud with four Rose oils from India, the Himalayas, Indonesia and France. The start of the fragrance is focused on the tantalizing animalistic character of the Oud from Laos, supported by Jasmine and Citruses. A voluminous accord of ambery Roses and Magnolia blossoms in the heart. The base consists of miscellaneous Oud oils, Civet and the Musk of Kabarga, which give the composition roundness and softness. This is how the precious fragrance maximally opening the heart of the wild Oud is born. No wonder, Oud Maximus is dedicated to the perfumer's son Maxim.Autumn '19 edition: New ingredient harvests and sourcing means this fragrance will not be exactly identical to the previous release.

Vetiver Nocturne Autumn 19 Extrait de Parfum,2489,Bortnikoff," If you think that you 100% aware of how vetiver can and should smell, you're probably wrong. This note requires a special attitude and deserves a dignified framing. Only under such conditions a vetiver composition of timeless beauty can be born. This is especially true when it comes to the precious Indian 25-year-old vetiver oil Ruh Khus, which forms the heart of VÃ©tiver Nocturne. In order to make the start of the fragrance greener, a young Ruh Khus is used: in its distillation process it passes through the copper pipes and thus acquires green color and smell. The base of the composition consists of the oils of Indonesian Sandalwood and Oud Trat, which were distilled by the perfumer himself with the use of a special infusion technique: during the distillation process wooded materials were enriched by the oils of White Champaca and Thai Jasmine. Floral notes revealed the beauty of Sandalwood oil extracted from the roots of centuries-old Sandalwood trees, which were cut down a long time ago and nowadays only their roots, which were preserved in the ground for years, are available to give us an aromatic material of the highest quality. Only the real Mysore Sandalwood, which is also generously used in the composition, can compete with it in terms of rarity and resplendence. It's hard to imagine a better framing for the Vetiver note than this.Autumn '19 edition: New ingredient harvests and sourcing means this fragrance will not be exactly identical to the previous release.

Love Mimosa Eau de Parfum,1239,Amouage," What is the scent of bliss? An open-ended question, to be certain, but perhaps a bit less so once you take a sniff of Love Mimosa. For those who already love the distinctive soft scent of this unique flower, rest assured that Love Mimosa features a sublime expression of it, quenchingly refreshing but with almond and honey facets sure to have your mouth watering. But just as importantly, even those who've never counted mimosa among their favorites will find plenty to adore in this fragrance, which seamlessly layers a bouquet of precious florals along with the titular flower to create a multidimensional portrait of feminine tranquility and beauty. Creamy orris, powdery violet, and sweet ylang all mix with a gentle, juicy pear and an exotic array of soft musks to weave a spell of pure delight, simultaneously innocent and sophisticated all at once. Love Mimosa is more than just a name- it's a promise."," Violet leaves, cascalone, orris, mimosa, pear, paradisone, ylang ylang, ambrox, heliotrope",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41897.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Female Christ Eau de Parfum,1784,19-69," On 29 May 1969, a naked woman carrying a cross walked through the Copenhagen Stock Exchange- an iconic piece of performance art carried out by Danish artists Lene Adler Petersen and BjÃ¸rn Norgaard that gripped the culture with its transgressive nature and exploration of religion, eroticism, and capitalism. However, as with so much of the genre-defying protest art of the '60s, only a photograph remains to commemorate the accomplishment. By introducing Female Christ the fragrance, a powerful, thoughtful, and deeply sensual blend of patchouli and resin, 19-69 preserves the essence of the art piece for the next generation to discover and learn. Female Christ is, first and foremost, a patchouli scent- rich, earthy, velvety, warm. Invigorating currents of spicy and herbaceous aromatics- eucalyptus, thyme, pimento- keep a bright liveliness in the foreground, while juicy rhubarb and berries add a sweet, fresh balance to the earthiness. As it dries, a sexy, provocative benzoin combines with dashes of vanilla and ambergris to transport the ever-present patchouli from the '60s milieu into something more transcendently contemporary, asserting the lasting significance of the piece that inspired the scent. 19-69 have already proven themselves masters of stylish, provocative patchouli scents- with Female Christ, they have raised the bar yet again."," Eucalyptus, patchouli, pimento, rhubarb, thyme, geranium, berries, vanilla, ambergris, benzoin, cinnamon, cashmere wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Atomic Rose Eau de Parfum,2244,Initio Parfums," If there's one thing Initio isn't known for, it's quiet fragrances- each release vibrates with an intense, sensual energy that's made the line an instant hit among stylish perfume lovers who want their signature scent to make a statement. Atomic Rose, their newest release, is another prime example of Initio's ability to find the harmonic balance between beauty and potency- a ravishingly sexy, invigoratingly unisex rose scent with liveliness and style to spare. Built around a ravishing duo of lush, top-quality Turkish and Bulgarian roses, Atomic Rose showcases every facet of its titular ingredient with carefully chosen supplemental notes- a juicy pop of bergamot, a spicy buzz of pink pepper, and a sumptuous blend of real florals (authentic Egyptian jasmine) and seductive floral derivatives (a potent dose of hedione) to seriously ramp up the power and sensuality. A long-lasting base of sweet, musky vanilla only deepens the effect, wrapping everything in a swoon-worthy haze. So no, Atomic Rose isn't the most naturalistic soliflore or softly-spoken feminine rose you've ever smelled- it's not meant to be. What it is, however, is rich, sexy, vivacious, and utterly unforgettable."," Bergamot, pink pepper, hedione, rose, jasmine, vanilla, ambrofix",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/802006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mizunara Eau de Parfum,2620,Parfum Satori," A fragrance inspired by the distinct character of Japanese oak and beech trees spread over a rippling lake deep in the woods, Mizunara is an intriguingly complex combination of aquatic herbal notes and smoky woods that transport you to a hauntingly lovely and ancient forest tableau. At first spray, bright green galbanum fills the senses, like a fresh wind passing across the lake surface, carrying with it the scent of lily pads and pond algae, mixing with the invigorating wild herbs that grow on the ground below- rosemary and clary sage. A sharp lavender sparkles like the light reflecting onto the nearby beech leaves. As the distinctively Japanese wood notes emerge in strength- sharp and stout, with smoky tones- the second meaning of this fragrance emerges. Japanese wood, after all, makes up the barrels that give aged Japanese whiskey their distinctive flavor, and the wood here is cut with sweet, dry cognac oil to evoke the slightest hint of boozy malt beneath the patchouli and resins of Mizunara's base notes. The cumulative effect is one that should please liquor drinkers and nature enthusiasts alike- a fresh, bright, powerful woods scent, replete with uniquely Japanese character, deep and sophisticated enough for lovers of complex niche, but not without its easy-to-wear charm. In other words, a true fragrant journey the quality of which we've come to expect from the always exceptional Parfum Satori."," Galbanum, rosemary, clary sage, lavender, cognac oil, juniper, cypress, patchouli, blue chamomile, labdanum, tulu balsam, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/768005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fall Into Stars Eau de Parfum,1711,Strangelove NYC," Fall Into Stars is a meditation on the universe itself: dark, mysterious, yet leaving a trail of powerful illuminations. The scent contains a core of pure oud, which gives fallintostars a deep, primal quality, emphasized with amber and labdanum notes. It's complemented by ingredients like pink peppercorn and rosewood, which make the scent dreamlike and ethereal.The stardust and pollen effect come from natural and wild French daffodil; a golden amber effect comes from a Fairwild certified Peru Balsam and a Siam Benzoin resin, which cast light from the back of the scent; and an illuminating solar effect comes from fresh ginger, bergamot and saffron. That ensemble is nested in a combination of ouds, For Life-certified roses, and henna flower."," Daffodil, pink pepper, ginger, bergamot, saffron, rose, henna, oud, rosewood balsam, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79309.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chypre-Siam Eau de Toilette,2486,Rogue Perfumery," Chypre-Siam is a joyful middle finger to IFRA. Unrepentedly teeming with enough oakmoss to make an EU official faint, this is a fragrance that lays lie to the notion that they ”˜just don't make ”˜em like they used to anymore.' With Chypre-Siam, Manuel Cross proves for once and for all that it's not only possible make an authentic chypre in this day and age, but that it's possible to do it so well that it sounds like a battle cry. But if all Cross were to do is mix oakmoss, bergamot, and labdanum resin together, it would be dull and derivative. Instead, Chypre-Siam has been designed as an irreverent ”˜South East Asian' take on the classic chypre, with a tart kaffir lime topnote replacing the traditional bergamot, and Thai holy basil to underline the minty bitterness of that oakmoss underpinning. Its raunchy, civet-inflected leather accord lends a lascivious purr that feels like labdanum ramped up beyond its normal range. And yet, despite the heavy-sounding notes, Chypre-Siam retains a fresh, translucent greenness all the way through – even the jasmine here smells more like violets in woodland than sultry white flowers. A warm, powdery trail lingers after the fireworks of the kaffir lime, oakmoss, and leather die down, the Siamese benzoin a sly nod to the South-East Asian inspiration for Chypre-Siam. Finally, a chypre that feels, smells, and actually is authentic."," oakmoss, kaffir lime, civet, jasmine, ylang, leather, spices, holy basil, sandalwood, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tabac Vert Eau de Toilette,2083,Rogue Perfumery," Tabac Vert is a gentle tobacco breeze blowing in from the past, when tobacco-focused fragrance compositions were not sweetened with vanilla or tonka bean. With references to vintage Tabarome and Krizia Moods, Tabac Vert presents us with a gentlemanly vision of what tobacco can smell like when played with a subtle hand.The tobacco leaf in Tabac Vert is green and unsmoked - not yet 100% dry - and therefore has none of that ambery, dried fruit sweetness we are used to in modern tobacco scents. The main supporting character here is a dusty, spicy carnation that adds a slightly vintage feel. However, remarkably, nothing about this scent reads as dated. A peppery sandalwood and a fine dusting of subtle florals – rose and jasmine – give the tobacco-carnation heart a soft roundness that's comforting without being particularly sweet. Although the references here are all to great tobacco masculines of the past, we can't help but feel that a woman could totally rock this too."," tobacco, carnation, oakmoss, sandalwood, amber, pepper, bergamot, rose, jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mousse Illuminee Eau de Toilette,2110,Rogue Perfumery," Mousse IlluminÃ©e is a delightful anachronism. It smells manly in the best possible way – soapy, bright, and almost cleansing in its bitterness, a cornucopia of camphoraceous green notes such as cypress, laurel, and artemisia stuffed into a cedar chest, aromatizing it from the inside out. FougÃ¨res used to smell like this, once upon a time, we remember. Now, shorn of any vanilla or sweetness, Mouse IlluminÃ©e returns the fougÃ¨re to its original form, stripping it back until we are left with a powerful and invigorating ”˜forest fern' accord that is unabashedly masculine.The deeply green atmosphere created by Mousse IlluminÃ©e revolves around a beautiful treemoss absolute from Robertet, but it is by no means the sole player. In particular, the minty laurel and camphoraceous aspects of the cypress and artemisia stand out, framed by an aquiline frankincense note that smells lightly smoky, but not burnt or severe. Best of all, there's no softening or fussiness towards the middle - a muscular musk simply carries the greenery on its broad shoulders to its natural conclusion."," treemoss, frankincense, green cypress, artemisia, laurel, cedar, white floral notes, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
40 Rogue Eau de Toilette,1834,Rogue Perfumery," 40 Rogue is a recreation of the long-discontinued 40 Love by Jean Desprez, a fragrance that was apparently an interesting cross between an animalic, 1970s-style musk and a fougÃ¨re. Given the opportunity to smell a vial of this forgotten gem, Manuel Cross decided that it wassimply too good to lose to the mists of time, and so here we are!Fragrance fans not used to vintage perfume, or even vintage-style perfume, may want to adjust their television sets. 40 Rogue initially smells very vintage, with a burst of hairspray-ish aldehydes, wax-coated fruit, and a dusty carnation setting the scene in a pre-war diner in Paris, its spine straight and hair coiffed to an inch of its life. But this rich, formal air relaxes quickly, loosening its stays to let in gusts of aromatic, sunburnt herbs, lemon, and creamy, animalic musks that recall a fresher Jicky or even a jazzed-up Jovan's Musk (original 1970s formula). Fuzzy fruit, moss, and hay-like narcissus folded into a barbershoppy musk – what's not to like here?"," citrus, aldehydes, fruity notes, basil, tarragon, carnation, rose, narcissus, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Derviche Eau de Toilette,1655,Rogue Perfumery," The brief Manuel Cross set himself for Derviche was simple – honor the famously soft green, powdery vanilla of vintage Emeraude by Coty but give it the power of one of those ambers coming out of the Middle-Eastern houses. In the end, Derviche smells very little like Emeraude but somehow features the same idea, which is to say a perfect balance struck between the tartness of citrus and the creamy sweetness of amber.At heart, Derviche is really all about hookah. The tobacco accord here is incredibly rich, with dried cherry facets that will make you think of revani, a Turkish semolina cake soaked in a honey syrup so sweet it's almost sharp. Unlike Ambre NarguilÃ© by Hermes, which Derviche resembles slightly, the ambery tobacco has a little animalic kick in its tail to keep things interesting. Civet and saffron act together to form a dry, slightly funky animal leather accord, while ambergris gives the dry-down a salty-sweet muskiness that's entrancing. If you love those big, insanely comforting old school balsamic ambers or tobaccos, then give this Derviche a whirl."," bergamot, labdanum, vanilla, jasmine, olibanum, sandalwood, musk, tobacco leaf, leather, saffron, civet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Radish x Vetiver Eau de Parfum,2185,Comme des Garcons: Clash," Radish and Vetiver- two roots with wildly different profiles. Vetiver, a staple of perfumery, grassy and sweet, earthy and spicy- a complex, multifaceted and often quite masculine aroma. Radish, on the other hand, not typically considered a desirably fragrant material, capable of the pungent sharpness of natural gas, but beneath the surface, possessed of a distinctive greenness and subtle citric qualities as well. An odd combination on paper, undeniably, but in the hands of Comme des Garcons, one that feels quintessentially CDG- the spice and earth of the vetiver made both more intense by the radish's petroleum-like tones, while also softened and brightened with the green elements. A scent that feels both uniquely natural and unnatural all at once- a sexy, fresh, and dare we say cutting-edge fragrance that anyone can pull off with panache. With Clashes like this, who needs to get along?"," Vetiver, radish, cypriol, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/839000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chlorophyll x Gardenia Eau de Parfum,2257,Comme des Garcons: Clash," Gardenia is a very distinctive note,  known as a feminine and heady floral scent. To create a ""Clash, "" CDG worked on breaking down this overpowering essence with the freshness of chlorophyll. The results are as surprising as they are delightful- the fresh,  airy greenness of the chlorophyll adds space and a touch of bitter contrast to gardenia's rich and romantic lushness,  transposing the scent into pure unisex territory,  with a vivacious energy to offset the natural floral warmth. Invigorating,  fun,  and glowing with sunny disposition,  Chlorophyll x Gardenia is the kind of quirky yet everyday-appropriate modern scent that CDG has mastered."," Chlorophyll, gardenia",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/839001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Celluloid x Galbanum Eau de Parfum,1805,Comme des Garcons: Clash," The association of Celluloid and Galbanum is by essence contradictory. They originate from the opposite realms of technology and nature, plastic and resin converging. But, of course, this is the brand that's given us Garage, Tar, Odeur 53, and Concrete, so should it really be a surprise when we say that Celluloid x Galbanum just... works? Most of all the Clash scents, Celluloid x Galbanum finds the unexpected serendipity between the powerful, naturally spiky green of galbanum, and the deeply evocative artificial freshness of celluloid, reminiscent of everything from plastic school binders to a fresh-from-the-box pair of sneakers. You'll want everything in your life to smell like this- clean, green, and blissfully relaxed. Not to shabby for such a contradiction."," Celluloid, galbanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/839002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The new Private Blend, alive with radiance and light-reflective ethereality, mimics the serene shimmer of sun on snow. The bright opening of bergamot and carrot seed mirrors the winter light, the cool reflection of the sun transforming everything in sight to a blanket of glacial white. The floral heart looks to the iridescent sky, blooming with pale petal shades of ivory and rose. The fresh green petals of jasmine grandiflorum, additive orange flower, and the transparent white floralcy of Karamalor Captive blends white blooms with the rich warmth of Turkish rose. The drydown melts onto skin with the wood and honey undertones of cistus labdanum, and skin-gripping musk as the resinous dimension of benzoin and creamy vanilla finish with sun-kissed warmth."," Bergamot, carrot seed, rose, jasmine, orange blossom, white flowers, rose, labdanum, benzoin, vanilla Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Soleil Neige by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Wonder Of You Eau de Parfum,1344,ALTAIA," We all love gigantic, luxuriously romantic scents- the kind that evoke the feeling of love at first sight. But Wonder Of You, the newest from Altaia, evokes a more subtle, but no less powerful kind of love- the joy of everyday love, a celebration of all the special moments and beautiful details that sustain a lifelong romance. It's a sparkling, soothing cocktail of citrus and florals that will have you basking in the glow of love from morning to night. From the first spritz, Wonder Of You is a pure and refreshing delight, opening with a mouthwatering blend of tart grapefruit and crisp blackcurrant that could put a smile on even the most weary face. A lovely heart of delicate freesia and juicy watermelon increases the lushness without an ounce of heaviness, and a smooth, clean musk drydown exudes gentle sensuality and understated sophistication. Is there a secret formula to a happy life with the one you love? We're obviously not qualified to answer that. But what Wonder Of You, in all of its understated beauty, suggests is that maybe it's as simple as taking pleasure in sharing the small and subtle joys of life. Who could argue with that?"," Blackcurrant, pink grapefruit, freesia, watermelon, ambrox, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73303.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Riviera Drive Eau de Parfum,1403,Atelier des Ors," The mythical scenic drive along the coastline of the French Riviera, so vividly captured in Hitchcock's To Catch A Thief with Grace Kelly and Cary Grant, is the inspiration for Riviera Drive, a thrillingly fresh new scent from Atelier des Ors. Just as the breathtaking views of the winding Cote d'Azure roads combine sun, sea, and flora as they weave through Menton on the way to St Tropez, so do does this fragrance combine vibrant citrus, electrifying aromatics, and sexy, soothing woody notes to evoke this iconic route. Riviera Drive opens with a vibrant spritz of bright lemon and the buzz of fresh herbs, giving us a grand panorama of the coastline from sky to land. As the woodsy notes emerge, we can picture our adventure taking us through the shade of the grand parasol pine trees, before a dash of intoxicating absinthe and a soothingly spiritual patchouli find us at our destination, exhausted but fulfilled, a sparkling cocktail in hand. Exhilarating and memorable, Riviera Drive is a summer delight."," Lemon, marjoram, rosemary, cedar leaf, absinthe, patchouli, cashmeran, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74411.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

We smell an abundance of citrus trees, laden with fruits and fragrant flowers, caressed by a gentle ocean breeze. It's a vivid portrait of paradise- a moment in time we hope will never end. The unique beauty of Pomelo Riviera is the natural interplay between juicy tartness- zesty, radiant grapefruit and refreshing bergamot- and the silky smoothness of the deeply soothing floral bouquet of orange blossom, jasmine, and rose. The crystalline sparkle of the salt accord refracts the intensity of the sunlight, refining it into a radiantly seductive glow. Lively yet relaxing, Pomelo Riviera is a dynamic unisex citrus floral to celebrate the simple, memorable pleasures of a beautiful day well spent by the ocean."," Grapefruit, jasmine, bergamot, orange flower, salt accord, rose, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74412.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Riviera Lazuli Eau de Parfum,2240,Atelier des Ors," The warmest and richest of Atelier des Ors' Riviera trilogy, Riviera Lazuli is blissful blend of tart citrus and robust wood with a slow transition into a glowingly warm incense resin that evokes an unforgettable sunset over the azure waters of the Mediterranean. The outstanding citrus notes that have defined all three scents is still here, bright, juicy and robust, with a characteristically energetic spray of saltwater, but while a complement of aromatic woods is still present and vibrant, Riviera Lazuli moves in a duskier direction, with incense and and hints of dried immortelle providing warmth and a touch of caramel-inflected spice. Balsam adds an even warmer element, evoking sun-heated driftwood and the glow of sunset on skin.

Yoyogi Eau de Toilette,2244,Comme des Garcons x Monocle," Yoyogi Park is one of the most beloved and celebrated green spaces in Tokyo. Nestled between the ultra-hip youth fashion mecca of Harajuku and the bustling social center of Shibuya, Yoyogi is a serene oasis, miles of soft grass, sparkling ponds, and the shade of gingko trees- a park for everyday Tokyo residents to congregate, relax, and play. Tyler BrûlÃ©, the founder of Monocle Magazine, found himself inspired during his morning jogs there, and so with the help of Comme des Garcons he set out to create a scent that captures the unique feeling of natural serenity that can occur in one of the world's busiest metropolises. And true to form, Yoyogi is a scent both serene and energetic, a perfect combination of soothing green notes resting on the negative space of the smoky, spicy cityscape beyond. Aromatic cypress lends a distinctly contemplative Japanese character, while the unmistakable crispness of freshly cut grass immediately puts us in BrûlÃ©'s jogging shoes on a dewey morning, the sun still low in the sky, the park nearly deserted and silent. As sweet, herbaceous chamomile and bitter, resinous wormwood emerge in the latter stages, we begin to experience the park- and Tokyo- at midday, an escape from the traffic and hustle but still fundamentally at the centre of the city- the kind of modern touch CDG is beloved for. Serene and natural, modern and exciting, all at one- that's the undeniably striking effect of a single spray of Yoyogi."," Cypress, mown grass, chamomile, wormwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chloe Sevigny Little Flower Eau de Parfum,1857,Regime des Fleurs," From her beginning days as a 90's streetwear fashion icon and ""the coolest girl in the world"" to an award-winning career in film and television, ChloÃ« Sevigny is truly one of a kind- a star who follows her own creativity and places passion over profit. Naturally, we knew her signature fragrance would have to be more than a by-the-numbers celebuscent, but Little Flower is so much more than we could have expected- a disarmingly fresh, exuberantly sexy rose that feels youthful and provocative all at once. Little Flower is built around rose, Sevigny's favorite note, and it's a beautiful specimen - a precious Ottoman rose absolute, romantic and bright, with a compellingly fleshy carnality. This raw appeal is tempered with sweet honeysuckle and fresh peony, and enhanced with the complexity of gently smoky black tea and the aromatic fruitiness of blackcurrant. A tart pomelo note adds a bright, youthful vivaciousness, which flows into a base of pillowy, clean musk. It's an arresting, versatile fragrance, to be worn by anyone with an artistic spirit and an independent soul. We'd expect nothing less."," Black tea, bleeding heart, blackcurrant bud, peony, palo santo, pomelo, honeysuckle, rose absolute, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65116.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Baie 19 Eau de Parfum,1694,Le Labo," Truth is...Baie 19 should have been called Water 19. Not that it smells like nothing (though nothing smells like it), but it has this crisp, wet, drenched effect that water gives to the earth after the rain...And there's a word for that, by the way: petrichor. It's that magical feeling during heavy rain after a long dry spell, and it's one of the most beautiful olfactive phenomena in nature. There are many reasons for this, including the ozone in the air, the negative ions, but most importantly the release of oil secretions from certain plants, accumulated after a long dry period. This is what Baie 19 is about: the dry juniper berry, the patchouli, the green leaves... all soaked by a beautiful, luminous, magnetic rain after a long drought. And the joy that comes with it...Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase. Please request at checkout in the comments box. What We Think Refreshing, gentle, and deeply comforting, this is a petrichor lover's dream skin scent."," Juniper, patchouli, ambroxan, cade, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46875.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Across The Ocean Eau de Parfum,2247,Gravel," The story of Gravel is one that connects two continents- Europe and North America- so it's only appropriate that their second scent is a tribute to the invisible ties between the two, and the luxurious overseas steamer ships of yesteryear that used to ferry people of all walks of life to and from the old country. Across The Ocean is a robust scent of smooth, deep woods, rich oud, and luxurious musk that exudes the gentlemanly sophistication of a bygone era. Citrus adds a light, bright touch to the opening notes, while tonka, musk, and vanilla soften and sweeten the richness of the woodsy base. Conceived by Joseph Knudsen as a men's scent, we find it easily wearable by anyone who enjoys potent but balanced woodsiness- the kind of scent that signifies good taste and adventurous spirit, all without shouting."," Bergamot, lemon, cashemere wood, oud, rose, tonka, gaiac, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/829001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Terrible Teddy Eau de Parfum,2122,Penhaligons," ""Teddy lives for the thrill of the chase, ensnaring unsuspecting hearts with his scent.""You can be forgiven if the plotlines of the Penhaligon's Portraits series have become a bit too convoluted to follow- to be honest, we're not quite sure we know what's going on at this point. Luckily, all that matters (aside from those jaw-dropping caps) is the scent, and Terrible Teddy is a robust, masculine, and surprisingly nuanced leather and incense gem. While the imposing golden rhinoceros certainly speaks to Teddy's impressive lasting power, there's refinement and subtlety at play here- the opening bursts with piquant spice, the leather is luxurious and supple, the incense delicately smoky with a perfectly metered dollop of dark woodsiness in the drydown, leavened with the warm airiness of ambroxan. With a secret weapon like this, it's no wonder Terrible Teddy has managed to ensnare so many unsuspecting hearts."," Incense, leather, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Heartless Helen Eau de Parfum,2858,Penhaligons," ""Who needs romance when one wields power?"" That's the tagline for Heartless Helen, which Penhaligon's tells us is the olfactory story of a fearless conquistadora, fresh off her latest conquest. But while we don't for a moment doubt that this fragrance, imbued with  seductively lively tuberose, could give anyone the power to steal and break a few hearts, we wouldn't be so quick to paint Helen as a villain. To us, her signature scent is not only deeply sensual but also joyful and vibrant, a bouquet of narcotic white florals freshened with bright, juicy mandarin to capture the imagination. A gently creamy, warm woodsiness (we detect facets of sandalwood, gaiac, and cedar) adds sophistication and depth to the drydown, but the star of the show- the gorgeous, intoxicating tuberose- lasts from beginning to end. Is Heartless Helen truly as wicked as they say? Perhaps with a scent this brightly beautiful, it doesn't matter much- we're already in too deep."," Mandarin orange, tuberose, creamy woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Plumeria de Orris Extrait de Parfum,1761,Areej Le Dore," This composition is dedicated to plumeria (known also as frangipani), the most gorgeous Asian flower. To find an extract that properly represents this flower is indeed a challenge. In Plumeria de Orris, we used nearly one kilogram of white frangipani extract that we believe captures the true nature of this exquisite blossom. We added a touch of genuine distilled plumeria oil, the rarest, most expensive floral essential oil we have ever encountered (at a price of over $200 per gram).Soft, powdery whispers of plumeria, full of narcotic, head-spinning, creamy floral notes, uplift the olfactory senses. Orris butter absolute further enhances its powdery splendor, making its floral soul even more expansive, deeper and longer lasting. A gentle touch of apricot, with its honeyed flesh and velvety suede skin, boosts the plumeria's fruity aspect. It adds juicy sweetness and an almost gourmand nuance to the top notes.Creamy floral notes slowly sink into buttery sandalwood. Wild aroma of civet adds a dash of animalic depth to the arrangement. Clouds of vanilla emerge from hiding behind the woods and deliver delicious olfactory joy.Dense and incensey myrrh embraces oriental notes. Rich and resinous, this time-honored ingredient blends perfectly with dark and sooty vetiver. Virginian cedarwood provides a smoky, woody texture that perfectly completes this lush, luxurious composition and creates a well-balanced earthy backbone.Plumeria, the floral soul of Asia, has been immersed in an apricot cocktail and magnified by oriental, incensey, animalic woods. Plumeria de Orris is a mesmerizing journey to Asia, a land that is both astonishingly wild and breathtakingly beautiful."," plumeria absolute, natural apricot accord and orris root absolute, sandalwood, vanilla and synthetic civet, myrrh, vetiver and cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/784017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Love Kills Eau de Parfum,1787,Masque Milano," While the concept of a soliflore might suggest simpler, more linear scents, one sniff of Love Kills should quickly disavow you of that notion. Instead, Caroline Dumur has created a rose soliflore with luscious yet edgy depth, one that masterfully plays off of the well known phrase it takes its name from to present both the romantic and dangerous sides of the grand dame of perfume florals.On the ""Love"" side of things, the fragrance opens with joyful brightness, using a mouthwateringly juicy lychee note to introduce a sparkling, ambrette-tinted rose oxide. As it blossoms into a full-bodied, romantic Turkish rose absolute, we see the darker, more sensual, ""Killer"" side of the equation- sultrier floral tones, animalic musk, and a woodsy patchouli distillation with a decidedly...thorny quality. It's a portrait of love in full- the joy, the hope, the intensity, and even the heartbreak, all contained within the multifaceted beauty of a rose."," Lychee, rose oxide, ambrette, geranium, rose oil absolute, green notes, patchouli, ambrarome, immortelle, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oriental Leather Eau de Parfum,1258,MEMO," At nightfall, the Wahiba Sands of Oman become a dreamscape of reddish dunes, casting a unique glow onto the sky above. The heavenly canopy lights up the path to Wadi Shab, a lush paradise, bursting forth from beyond the sand, etching itself permanently into the imagination.A majestic and sophisticated scent, Oriental Leather is a rich tapestry of piquant spice, smooth resins, and a dusty floral leather note that combines with rich, dry patchouli to produce visions of a glowing desert night where the stars and the sand connect so seamlessly that it's impossible to tell where one ends and the next begins. At turns shimmeringly piquant and alluringly rich, it seems to dance on the skin, hypnotizing us with its exotic and otherworldly call. Like the Omani desert night sky, Oriental Leather is a magical, unforgettable experience."," Coriander, pimento, lavender, leather, anise, geranium, cinnamon, benzoin, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69126.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rolling in Love Eau de Parfum,2737,By Kilian," Rolling in Love is a musc de peau, capturing the sensation of feeling so high on love that it seems to almost“get under the skin.” Working with perfumer Pascal Gaurin, Kilian Hennessy took an entirely new direction. Rolling in Love is more direct and less faceted than his previous fragrances””almost“monochromatic” in its focused representation of a single emotion. Rolling in Love is a“white” scent, layering different textures along the scent's trail with notes of ambrette seeds, almond milk, iris, and musk. What We Think It may be conceived as a ""skin musk""  but there's plenty going on in this undeniably sexy blend of narcotic florals, creamy almond, and smooth, sensual musks. You won't be able to stop sniffing yourself- or anyone wearing it."," Almond milk, iris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425201.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ambre Khandjar Eau de Parfum,2647,Une Nuit Nomade," The souq of Muttrah, found in the heart of Muscat, is the perfect place to search for a legendary Khandjar dagger- the identity, pride and heritage of Oman that carries the virtues of luck and protection from evil. They say wearing a Khandjar is like carrying a piece of the Omani soul, and Ambre Khandjar is a tribute to the power of tradition. It is a powerful oriental amber, sweet and rich with syrupy plum and warm resin. Modern metallic facets and a lingering of leather and vanilla make it timeless, warm and addictive. A scent of skin tanned by the sun and the cold of metal, Ambre Khandjar is a timeless treasure worthy of its namesake."," Mandarin, Black Plum, Cistus Labdanum Aboslute, Vanilla Pod O2, Orris Absolute, Ylang Ylang, Sandalwood, Patchouli, Benzoin Resinoid",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Jardins de Misfah Eau de Parfum,1366,Une Nuit Nomade," In the village of Misfah Al Abreyeen, a cornucopia of pomegranates, peaches, figs, and apricots grow abundantly in the midst of the mountain aridity, with marvelous palm trees as far as the eye can see, their branches heavy with the weight of dates. It is the bounty of legend come to life, an ingeniously engineered garden paradise created by warriors who set down their weapons to grow instead of destroy.Jardins de Misfah is a harmony of ripeness- a whisper of fresh flower petals fused with an accord of creamy dates, syrupy honey and sweet rosewater. A delicate yet deliberate dusting of exotic spices deepens the feminine sensuality, while a gently green and powdered almond provides an unconventionally smooth gourmand base. Fresh, rich, and mouthwatering all at once, Jardins de Misfah is a gorgeously wearable portrait of abundance."," Cardamom, Nutmeg, Date Accord, Rose Absolute, Rose Essence, Saffron, Almond",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Suma Oriental Eau de Parfum,1459,Une Nuit Nomade," Suma Oriental refers to the brilliant collection of writings by TomÃ© Pires, a Portugese apothecary who became ambassador to China in the 16th century. An intensely detailed description of an insular southeast Asia, Suma Oriental revealed for the first time that sandalwood originated in the Sumba, or modern day Indonesia. So it's only fitting that Suma Oriental is a portrait of sandalwood in all of its rich dimensionality, a mesmerizing scent that pairs creamy, warm sandalwood with boozy rum, velvety patchouli, and powdery tonka to create a lushly seductive fragrance that hums with mystery and majesty. A robust cocoa note adds sweet, earthy complexity, while a gaiac-forward base of smooth woods supplement the sandalwood's mouthwatering depth. Like Pires' seminal work, Suma Oriental invites us to discover an exotic and captivating unknown world- don't miss your opportunity."," Cypriol, Rum, Cocoa, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Tonka Bean, Cashmere Wood, Gaiac Wood, Clear Wood, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mr. Vetiver Eau de Parfum,1681,Une Nuit Nomade," This is a story about a man who you may have encountered somewhere near Java. People say he is tall, with skin that has been tanned by the sun and tattooed by the passage of time. His blue gaze plunges into the viewfinder of his Leica- but who is he? An olfactory portrait of a legendary Javan photographer and gadfly, Mr. Vetiver turns out to be a fragrance both exotic and sporty, relaxed and refined- a perfect demonstration of all that vetiver can do. Opening with a buzz of fresh citrus and spice, Mr. Vetiver instantly demonstrates a comfort with the complexity of its titular ingredient, which is featured in full- earthy, grassy, sweet, clean, woodsy, and spicy, all in perfect harmony. Rich, mouthwatering cardamom sidles up smoothly beside aromatic basil and tarragon, and a unique piri-piri pepper adds a fiery touch of distinction. The results are as versatile and easy to wear as they are undeniably compelling. An elegant fragrance revealing the freshness of Vetiver in a spicy and delicate accord, Mr. Vetiver is a man-about-town you're going to want to get acquainted with."," Cardamom, Grapefruit, Lime, Basil, Tarragon, Geranium, Vetiver.

Fleur des Fleurs Eau de Parfum,1639,Une Nuit Nomade," Bali, island of flowers. The ylang-ylang, sweet, rich, and luscious, is so highly prized for its complex fragrance and incomparable benefits for the mind and body that it means 'Flower of Flowers' in the Malay language. And jasmine is the queen of the night, patiently waiting for sunset so she can release her powerful, warm perfume into the air. Fleur des Fleurs is an ode to ylang-ylang and jasmine, an intense white floral accord with deep, romantic lushness. Freshness is provided with the crisp citric tang of grapefruit and the mouthwatering savor of saffron, while a deep, woodsy base of sandalwood and amber nourishes the soul. A tropical floral of depth and character, Fleur des Fleurs more than earns its superlative."," Bergamot, Saffron, Grapefruit, Jasmin, Ylang-Ylang, Tubereuse, Glycine, Benzoin Tears, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Amber, Oud Wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Murmure des Dieux Eau de Parfum,2645,Une Nuit Nomade," Bali the Spiritual, the island that wakes up slowly each day to the rhythm of offerings. This is a time when women gather freshly cut flowers to accompany their religious rituals. Bali's iconic flower is the 'Jepun', or frangipani. It has a particular prestige for the Indonesian people and is part of their mystique; its vivid colors decorate most temples. Both a symbol of the god Shiva and a way to channel prayers, the frangipani flower evokes the island's inner voice. Murmure des Dieux is the very expression of lightness of the soul. An airy perfume taking the form of a reassuring whisper. An olfactory phrase like a mantra on the skin. This delicate accord intertwines the slightly almond and refined sweetness of the Frangipani flower, the unctuousness of vanilla and the reassuring roundness of musks. Mumure des Dieux is an exotic, singular and extremely carnal perfume."," Frangipani, Almond, Vanilla, Musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bohemian Soul Eau de Parfum,2900,Une Nuit Nomade," In 1966 the documentary 'Endless Summer' was released, chronicling two American surfers' quest for the perfect wave. From the end of their surfboards, we experience the desire to push time zones further away so the summer never ends. This quest continues, with the entire planet becoming a refuge of immense beaches punctuated with hiding places where free spirits love to converge.Bohemian Soul is a bracing, invigorating, and ultimately deeply soothing fragrance that reflects this journey with elegance and modernity: the immediate freshness of artemisia, like a gentle wind rising up over the ocean, giving way to rooty iris and clean guaiac wood before the flourish of creamy sandalwood and the delicacy of soft, seductive musk entwine. It's a primally comforting mix, the kind of fresh musky scent perfect for women and men alike who crave clean and sporty in equal measures- a freshness that's as far from boring as the vagabonds and surfer kings who inspired it in the first place."," Artemisia absinthium, Olibanum, Guaiac Wood, Iris, Myrrh, Musc, Sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Memory Motel Eau de Parfum,1060,Une Nuit Nomade," When Andy Warhol moved to Montauk, he became an anchor point, a lighthouse for an entire generation of artists. He rented his mansion for a summer to the Rolling Stones, who were rehearsing for their tour and pre-recording what would be one of their greatest albums, ”˜Black and Blue', which included the melancholy ballad ”˜Memory Motel'.This eponymous perfume is a burning tribute to those restless, turbulent times. An androgynous perfume with notes of tobacco wrapped in patchouli leaves, pierced with a touch of vanilla. Smoky, spicy, mossy, and floral, with just the slightest hint of sweetness, it feels like it could be the smell of an iconically kitschy motel hallway, faded carpet and cigarette smoke, primally comforting, with seduction, adventure, relaxation, and beautiful mundanity hidden behind each subsequent door."," Bergamot, Iris, Incense, Carnation, Mosses, Patchouli, Vanilla, Tobacco, Leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kalan Eau de Parfum,2271,Parfums de Marly," The true majesty of French formal gardens comes in the blend of imposing strength and gentle beauty only achievable with great expense and effort--a perfect synthesis of elegance and majesty. In Kalan, Parfums de Marly captures that beautiful balance through the juxtaposition of two quintessentially French heart notes--lush, lovely orange blossom, and bright, masculine lavender, for a fragrance that evokes the breathtaking splendor of the gardens at Versailles itself.Intense and subtle all at once, Kalan surprises with a sparkling opening, blending black pepper and spices with juicy, invigorating notes of blood orange. The fragrance's essence is embodied in the aforementioned heart of orange blossom and lavender, soft and sharp, intertwining to wondrous effect. And in a deep, unforgettable base, facets of white sandalwood unfold and drape into notes of moss and precious wood--an exploration that takes us from the gardens to the forest and back again. Bright, smooth, utterly captivating, Kalan immediately places itself in the firmament of Parfum de Marly's absolute best."," Blood Orange, Black Pepper, Lavender, Solar notes, Orange Blossom Absolute, Moss, Precious Wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/700030.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aventus Cologne Eau de Parfum,1760,Creed," How does one go about reinventing a classic? If you're the house of Creed, you take everything that people loved about Aventus and Aventus For Her and bring it all together in a universal scent that can be enjoyed by men and women alike. Meet Aventus Cologne, a fresher, more modern complement to two iconic scents that provides an olfactive experience all its own. The woody fresh Aventus Cologne opens with bright giner, mandarin, and pink pepper, giving an invigorating unisex start that Aventus devotees should find both recognizable and novel. An earthier, deeper heart reveals notes of rich patchouli, creamy Indian sandalwood, and spicy, lightly citric vetiver. And while robust, elegantly masculine birch still sings in the long-lasting base, it's now refined with resinous styrax, and a smoothly unisex combination of musk and tonka bean which exudes graceful power. Aventus and Aventus For Her fanatics have always known there was something special at the core of their scents- now, it's all in one completely irresistible package--a new modern classic."," Ginger, mandarin, baie rose, patchouli, sandalwood, vetiver, styrax, birch, musk, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49376.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Harem Soiree Parfum,2778,Arte Profumi," A boozy rose dipped in honey and plunged into the salty rawness of ambergris, Harem Soiree is a stunning attar-like fragrance that takes no prisoners in the floral oriental genre. The ambergris lends a fiercely saline, windswept edge to the ambery underpinnings of the fragrance, joining with a resinous, licorice-like myrrh to render a picture of an unsweet, unpolished chunk of amber resin that has just washed up on a beach somewhere along the Baltic coast. The textural contrasts in Harem Soiree are incredibly satisfying, especially in the juxtaposition of the syrupy, honeyed rose against the rough-edged, salt-and-pepper dryness of the ambergris and myrrh notes. Rich in a mouthwateringly sweet-and-savory way that keeps you interested all day long, Harem Soiree has the additional advantage of being hugely radiant and sillage-aceous - outwitting humidity, showers, or whatever else you can throw at it. To wear Harem Soiree is to be bathed in your own personal halo of roses, precious resins, and salty ambergris, saturating the air around you in a heavy rose-gold hue. Divine."," ambergris, rose, myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Velvet Rouge,1402,Arte Profumi," Velvet Rouge is not for a perfume for wallflowers. Immediately enveloping and rich, it lustfully embraces the bold statement that only coffee beans, licorice, and cacao pods can make when exposed to high heat – a delightfully aromatic, burnt aroma that fans of both Borneo 1838 by Serge Lutens and Coze by Parfumerie Generale will adore. Despite its cocoa-dusted opening, however, Velvet Rouge steers well away from the gourmand elements of its dark materials, choosing instead to chase the cocoa down with a hit of bright, spicy chili pepper and a dusting of nutmeg. With a rooty, slightly dirty-grungy vetiver and what smells to us like a ton of sooty frankincense bringing up the rear instead of the usual vanilla or amber, Velvet Noir retains its slightly austere, mysterious character throughout. It finishes out on an unusual accent of smoked-out licorice. A scent full of shadows and secrets, Velvet Rouge is perfect for those of few words and un-guessed-at depths."," cacao pod, coffee, chili pepper, mandarin orange, nutmeg, vetiver, licorice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bois Sacre Parfum,1856,Arte Profumi," Bois Sacre, or sacred wood, is an artistic rendering of the yin and yang character of two of the most precious woods in the world, namely Indian oud and sandalwood. Cleverly playing the animalic, leathery sourness of Indian oud off against the buttery, aromatic dryness of Indian sandalwood, the result is a scent that is exuberantly rich and full-flavored but not in the slightest bit heavy. The medley of woods here seems to shimmer in the air like the red dust over a North African desert. If the woods are remarkably airy, the doughy, treacly resinousness of labdanum moves quickly into place underneath to ground them. Growing ever drier and leatherier over time, we love how the labdanum lends an earthy, resinous heft that acts as a center of balance for the scent without ever drowning the woods in the buttery sweetness of vanilla. There's even a dusty ”˜hot paper' note in the drydown that makes us think of benzoin, even though none is listed. Dry but rich, this is the perfect woody oriental for cold weather."," agarwood (oud), sandalwood, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Samharam Parfum,2866,Arte Profumi," Samharam is a rich incense scent that traces a straight line to the ancient aromas of myrrh and benzoin that would have accompanied the caravan traders that moved from across the deserts from the spice and resin markets of Somalia and Oman to Venice and beyond. Opening with a triumphantly coca cola-ish myrrh with smoky licorice overtones, Samharam rolls on like a stone, picking up the deeply sooty nuances of Somali frankincense and elemi, as well as the sweeter ”˜hot brown paper' powderiness of benzoin. Samharam smells both sacred and profane, the ethereal ”˜High Church' lift of the incense raising our thoughts up to the heavens, while all the time enticing our more gustatory senses with a pleasing bite of black pepper and a slightly salty amber. Although not foody in the slightest, there's something piquant in this incense accord that pricks the saliva glands and makes our bellies growl. Incredibly full-figured and rich, as all Arte Profumi fragrances are, Samharam is the old world Italian artisanal response to the thin and bony incense scents of modern lore."," myrrh, incense, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sucre Noir Parfum,2957,Arte Profumi," Sucre Noir deserves the same Holy Grail status granted by vanilla lovers to Tihota by Indult or Vaniglia by Mazzolari. One of the most luxurious vanilla scents we've ever smelled, it is the olfactory equivalent of being wrapped up in the purest, ”˜whitest' cashmere blanket that costs  more than most of us earn in a month. There's a luxury in its simplicity, because there's nowhere for any mistakes to hide. Recalling nothing more than the nostalgic goodness of white sugar infused with the sultry warmth of a vanilla bean or two, and perhaps a breath of cocoa-dusted vanilla orchid, it is the sort of  vanilla we loved first while learning about taste and smell – that pure ”˜white' sort of sweetness as of yet unsullied by smoke, musk, or resin. The cane sugar is the perfect final touch, its slightly burnt, brown sugar aroma adding an interesting caramelization that creates depth but not shade. Vanilla lovers – we are putting you on notice!"," orchid, vanilla pod, sugar cane",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oeilleres Parfum Extrait,1561,Roberto Greco,"“I want to echo the flowers I photograph without referring to any one in particular. Therefore, along with Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, we decided to exclude rose, jasmine and all the overly tangible flowers. We managed to express the general idea of floralcy through the dried flower, pollen and honey facets of chamomile and broom. To connect the scent with the figures I photograph, I also wanted to convey the feel of flesh. In order to achieve this, we brought out the animal aspects of vegetal notes, as well as various spices and resins.  Though it wasn't an end in itself, the fragrance is bursting with natural ingredients – sometimes in very high doses, all the better to express the organic duality of my images. Between the delicacy of a fading petal and the radicality of a fold of skin.” ”” Roberto GrecoÅ’illÃ¨res - L'Objet parfumant is the anti-flower fragrance, a truly rare, beautiful creation.

Slow Dance Eau de Parfum,1736,BYREDO," The slow dance: a rite of passage for girls and boys before they metamorphose into women and men. A feeling of exhilaration tempered, or perhaps heightened, by awkwardness. A heady collision of innocence and experience, knowing and not knowing, felt universally across countries, cultures, and time. Slow Dance: a scent that evokes these collective memories and experiences in a unisex oriental amber, bitter and sweet, intoxicating and youthful. A top note of sweet myrrh provides an immediate honeyed, smoky sensuality against a heart of creamy, ambery labdanum and sparkling fresh geranium. All is swathed in a magical veil of violet, while a base of vanilla and patchouli anchor the amber notes, a contrast between sweet and earthy, mouthwatering and mysterious, that brings our minds back to school gymnasiums and stolen kisses. Between childhood and adulthood, our deepest and most profound memories are formed. Spray on Slow Dance, and find yourself transported back to that unforgettable place."," Opoponax, geranium, labdanum, violet, vanilla, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641204.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Air Des Alpes Suisses Eau de Parfum,2362,Tauer Perfumes," Andy Tauer has a singular gift for olfactory mise en scene: fragrances so majestically evocative that you feel transported not only to a location, but into an experience: strolling through a Rahat marketplace at sunset (L'Air du Desert Marocain), ripping down Route 66 in a panhead Harley-Davidson (Lonesome Rider), or looking up at the Southwest sky next to a crackling fire (Lonestar Memories). For his newest experience, Andy invites us to the country where he lives and creates amongst the pristine natural beauty of the Swiss Alps.L'Air Des Alpes Suisses opens bright, fresh, and invigorating, with notes of bitter, lively alpine herbs and cool glacier air. As if on our own Swiss adventure, our journey then leads us into the fresh, green heart, the air rich with blooming alpine lilies and pine needles drying on the forest floor. And finally, we smell the warm woods of the timber trees, sweetened with the amber tones of earth drying in the midday sun.

La Couche du Diable Eau de Parfum,2336,Serge Lutens," La Couche du Diable (we'll choose to forego some of the raunchier translations and simply call it ""The Devil's Bed"") was bound to cause a fuss- after all, throughout his many releases, Serge Lutens has never before featured oud in a fragrance. But with that in mind, don't expect anything resembling a typical oud scent. Oh, there's an unmistakably high-quality oud in here- darkly woodsy, warm, and sweetly balsamic- but its more challengingly animalic tones are, if not subverted, at least channeled into resinous cistus and syrupy fruit-and-rose combination that incite a sense of deep, seductive comfort. Serge Lutens' own copy describes La Couche du Diable as ""a diabolical and sumptuous veil of indulgence and remorse for a first transgression."" We'd agree, up to a certain point- but if we're being honest, when it comes to this stunning fragrance- remorse doesn't even cross our mind."," Oud accord, cistus jam, fruity complex, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36169.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Baikal Leather Intense Eau de Parfum,2156,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," In the seemingly endless expanse of the Siberian birch forests, the majesty and power of nature can leave one with a humbling and awe-inspiring new perspective on where they fit into the hierarchy of the natural world. This breathtaking natural beauty is the inspiration for Patricia and Axel de Nicolai's newest leather scent, a robust yet velvet-soft offering that eschews the garishness of brutal, flashy leathers for the smoothness of freshly-tanned suede, placed expertly in the midst of the crisp and invigorating scents of a wild Siberian birch forest. The leather aspect of this EDP is essentially created by blending two dry, woody notes: essence of gaiac wood and essence of smoked pine. This powerful duet is revealed by a fiery start of spicy citrus with yuzu, pepper and saffron, while the aromatic touch of spearmint completes the top note. The floral heart of rose and violet envelops the leather, softened by an iris butter, tonka beans and white musk background. Robust yet refined, Baikal Leather is a leather of unusual distinction."," Yuzu, pepper, saffron, leather, birch, violet, rose, iris butter, gaiac, sandalwood, vetiver, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313060.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Corpi Caldi Eau de Parfum,1411,Profumi del Forte," Who says grown-up fun needs to be so, well, grown up? Corpi Caldi is inspired by evenings under the stars with dear friends, sipping sweet, fizzy cocktails. It's dancing the night away to an irresistible jazz orchestra, laughing and spinning and embracing the joy life still has to offer. And with a bright yet sophisticated, fresh and mouthwatering combination of floral and gourmand notes, Corpi Caldi truly embodies the idea of carefree, yet distinctively grown-up revelry. It's a distinction that shines through from the very first spray, as a sunny and fresh combination of plum and grapefruit is given an aromatic complexity with gardenia leaf and a striking pop of mint. The floral bouquet at the heart is no less unique, with the lushness of orange blossom and rose enhanced with a cool, earthy iris and a sweet twist of ylang. And in the sumptuous base, creamy vanilla is kissed with an ambergris glow and the lightly almond-inflected tones of heliotrope. All together, it creates a rare accomplishment- a lush, fruity gourmand that offers multiple surprises, but no unpleasant shocks. In other words, it's the sort of adult fragrance that proves that growing up can just make life better and better."," Gardenia leaf, plum, grapefruit, mint, ylang ylang, orange blossom, rose, iris, patchouli, vanilla, oakmoss, white musks, ambergris, heliotrope",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53615.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Elae Eau de Parfum,1810,Cire Trudon," Elae wears its femininity like a luminous offering: it unfolds like a bouquet of white petals with woody notes, filled with warmth and tenderness. Of proud descent, Elae is embedded, through her Latin name, with the protective aura of Diana, goddess of the hunt. A clear evocation of faraway lands that need to be conquered, Elae is fragrant with flowers yet bears a narcotic sensuality. Elae unfolds like a transparent floral perfume with light notes that float."," African neroli, Ylang-Ylang, Egyptian jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/559082.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Squid Extrait de Parfum,2515,Zoologist," The vast ocean swells and contracts, caught in the relentless tug of the moon. Beneath the surface, a school of squid emerges. Strange, elastic forms propel from the deep in a frantic search for sustenance. They are not alone. Their predators lunge, only to be foiled by blinding jets of murky ink. A massive sperm whale dives, leaving a temporary peace bobbing in its wake. Lumps of ambergris, expelled by the whale and polished by the salty currents, wash ashore. Waste? Flotsam? To the perfumer, this elusive substance is nothing less than treasure.Zoologist Squid sings a song of a dark, tumultuous sea of tangy brine, the stormy air electrified with pink pepper and the elemental glow of salicylate. Crisp, smoky incense evokes an ominous twilight, while a uniquely sweet, cloudy ink accord should leave no doubt why this unforgettable scent earned its name. Finally, all is united with the moody, compellingly oceanic aroma of ambergris. Like the endless depths that inspired it, this elegant scent ripples with the mysteries of the sea."," Pink Pepper, Solar Salicylate, Incense, Black Ink Accord, Salty Accord, Opoponax, Ambergris, Benzoin, Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/760025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sir Winston Extrait de Parfum,2942,Bortnikoff," To pay tribute to a man of globe-spanning accomplishment, a fragrance of ordinary ingredients and vision just wouldn't do. Sir Winston, we're pleased to report, is no ordinary fragrance. Rather, it is a dynamic blend of some of the world's most exquisite ingredients, including real ambergris, rich tobacco, and an unparalleled specimen of Indonesian Bouya oud oil. The effect is a fragrance that celebrates the rugged, uncategorizable, self-determined man- a scent of strength and adventure. Sir Winston is unique right from the start, as a combination of smooth green tea and a possibly unlisted boozy note combine to deliver the rich, sweet, bracing kick of a tumbler of exquisite brandy. Warm, sun-kissed ambergris softens the rougher edges of a raw tobacco absolute, imposing and regal, while precious Indonesian oud meets vanilla for a mouthwatering yet sensual animalism. Not every man (or woman) can pull off Sir Winston, but that's on purpose- those who can are surely already part of a rare and impressive cohort."," Green Tea, Tuberose, Ambergris, Tobacco Absolute, Vanilla, Indonesian Bouya (oud)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Symphonie de Neroli Extrait de Parfum,1111,Bortnikoff," While every Bortnikoff fragrance is surely a symphony- a masterful blending of the best ingredients in the world to produce something more than the sum of its parts- you might be initially surprised that Symphonie de Neroli is the one that earned the symphonie right in the title. After all, this is arguably Bortnikoff's most focused, uncomplicated-feeling scent so far, a bright, cheerful, naturalistic celebration of perfume's most beloved white floral. But one glance at the impressive notes list, and it's plain to see that this seemingly simple soliflore is as complex a creation as any- with each exquisite ingredient carefully selected to enhance the beauty of neroli in full. Bright, dynamic citrus gives intense freshness, while rich jasmine sambac supplements neroli's lush, romantic tones. Exceptional Javan and Indian vetiver alongside Virginian cedarwood coax out the woodsy and spicy elements, joining a balsam-infused oud to create a warm, glowing base that feels entirely in the spirit of neroli. Fresh, lush, spicy, romantic, rich, warm? Finally, a neroli scent that truly lets you have it all."," Bergamot, Lemon, Lime, Clementine, Neroli, Jasmine Sambac, Vetiver from Java, Vetiver from India (Ruh Khas), Ambergis, Oakmoss, Virginian Cedar, Oud from Trat, Peru Balsam, Tolu Balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Zemfira Extrait de Parfum,1053,Bortnikoff," Zemfira is the positively delightful answer to a simple question: what if a rose-oud scent didn't take itself quite so seriously? This, of course, isn't to say that any aspect of Zemfira is less than the utmost quality- from pure Vietnamese oud oil to Europe's finest Rose de Mai to authentic Atlas cedarwood, Zemfira is undoubtedly fit for royalty. But this is a brighter, fresher, more youthful rose-oud than you've experienced before- less Queen, more Princess- with juicy bergamot, zesty pink pepper, and a blend of the aforementioned Rose de Mai with an especially fresh, young tea rose that positively sings with young energy. The oud, too, is vibrant- green, bright, and not at all barnyard funky, and blended perfectly with creamy sandalwood and stout, fresh cedar to take an often exotic and heavy pairing and reinvent it as romantic and energetic. Rose-oud lovers looking for something you've never smelled before? Make haste for Zemfira- but leave your stuffy preconceptions at the door."," Bergamot, Pink Pepper, Rose de Mai, Hybrid Tea Rose, Atlas Cedar, Bengalian Sandalwood, Vietnamese Oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Los Angeles Eau de Parfum,2254,Gallivant," A perfect day in Los Angeles might start early, as a sparkling ray of morning sunlight illuminates an abundance of flowering native florae. That same day might end late, but not too late, as the last notes of your favorite band echo off the starlit hills surrounding the Hollywood Bowl. Sure, L.A. may not have much of a claim to being The City That Never Sleeps, but with beginnings and endings as beautiful as ours, who says that's a bad thing?That perfect morning spent in your blooming garden? That's the airy, aromatic opening of Los Angeles, as vivid notes of eucalyptus and clary sage, along with a spritz of oceanside saltiness, stimulate a sense of calm, relaxed, natural energy- the very spirit of L.A. itself. A rich and spicy floral heart- tuberose and narcissus- celebrates the vibrant and romantic Mexican culture diffused through the heart of the city. And finally, a smoky, woodsy, shimmering base of cade and gaiac represents the boundless and far-flung nightlife, which often combines L.A.'s reputation for creativity and artistic innovation with the bounty of natural beauty and outdoor space at our fingertips. Sure, we might head home before the sun comes up- but as Gallivant's perfect tribute to our hometown proves, it's because tomorrow promises to be just as full of adventure as today."," Eucalyptus, clary sage, mandarin, pineapple, tuberose, narcissus, cade, gaiac, nagarmotha, musk, heliotrope",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Keep Glazed Eau de Parfum,1613,The House Of Oud," Patisserie and perfume- two art forms dedicated to sensory pleasure and indulgence, where skilled execution and artistic vision are equally important if one is to create a masterpiece. Keep Glazed, THoO's collaboration with Canadian Patisserie's Ksenia Penkina, is indeed a perfect fusion of talent and technique, as delectable flavours of tropical fruit and rich pastry are blended with a deft and delicate touch, creating a mouthwatering yet complex gourmand scent of rarified sophistication. Keep Glazed opens with a sumptuous collection of fruit-based notes that reveal their depth in the details- the tart, icy snap of frozen lemon, the aromatic freshness of strawberry leaf, and the juicy tropical energy of wild mango. Chantilly cream stands out beyond an average vanilla note, sweet yet airy, and never cloying as lesser vanillas can be, joining with flakes of coconut and a gently fiery ginger crumble to bring a true dimensionality to this perfectly balanced confection. And even hours later, the softly musky, woodsy base keeps everything humming- sexy, scrumptious, but never showing off. There are many gourmands out there, but few with the careful detail and fruit-forward dynamism of Keep Glazed- and we couldn't be happier."," Frozen lemon, mango, strawberry leaf, chantilly cream, grated coconut, ginger crumble, fruity musk, precious woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76426.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ristretto Intense Cafe Extrait de Parfum,1609,Montale," For those who appreciate quality over quantity, the ristretto is a mark of culinary character- a short shot of espresso that delivers intense yet smooth flavor in a single sip. With Ristretto Intense Cafe, Montale refines their already beloved combination of robust coffee, lush rose, and warm vanilla with a richer, more concentrated version that pairs multiple facets of rose and coffee alongside a captivating sweet toffee note to increase both teh sophistication and the pure indulgence. Fans of the original will recognize the iconic coffee opening, but as is befitting the Ristretto version, the note is both smoother and darker, combining with a fresh, vegetal rose to produce an unexpectedly dry and refreshing top note. As the coffee softens, the lusher aspects of rose strike a sensuously familiar tone, while a vanillic white musk emerges, slightly sweetening the brew with just a hint of cream and sugar. For lovers of Intense Cafe looking for the next level as well as anyone seeking superb, sophisticated gourmand scents, Ristretto Intense Cafe is a demi-tasse of pure magic."," Italian black coffee, rose water, rosebud, roasted coffee beans, dry wood, vanilla, white musk, sweet toffee, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Instant Crush Eau de Parfum,2175,Mancera," We all know the feeling: with a single glance your jaw drops, your knees buckle, and every last thought in your head is replaced with pure infatuation. It's this magic that Mancera has on its hands with Instant Crush, an irresistible combination of rose, jasmine, and amber that balances playful sweetness and lush sensuality in a way that anyone who's ever experienced love at first sight knows all too well. Against an opening pop of bright, juicy citrus, a fiery vein of ginger and saffron lends a dry, spicy elegance that leads seamlessly into the lush, romantic floral amber heart. The perfect proportions of sweet musk and creamy, woodsy vanilla prolong the sophistication, placing Instant Crush in the firmament of sweet, dry, spicy floral orientals that fans of classics like Baccarat Rouge 540 can't get enough of. But please, don't take our word for it- as you'd hope from a scent called Instant Crush, one sniff is likely all you'll need to turn your world upside-down."," Bergamot, mandarin, saffron, ginger, rose, jasmine, amber woods, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla, oakmoss, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/649041.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Labyrinth Of Spices Extrait de Parfum,1243,Alghabra Parfums," Few world landmarks represent quite the smorgasboard of olfactory delights as the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul. With over 4,000 shops across more than 60 covered streets, it's a veritable cornucopia of fragrant treasures, from spice and tea markets to exotic fruits to exquisite leather and woodwork. Labyrinth Of Spices, as you might expect, is a sweeping journey through this iconic and bustling marketplace and its many aromas- a treasure chest of sweets, spices, woods, and more- but for anyone who appreciates the sophistication of a gentler touch, we're pleased to report that the experience is as smooth and luxurious as a palanquin ride. Cardamom-infused coffee, sweet clove, and fiery nutmeg anchor the rich bouquet of spices, while green galbanum and sharp lavender inject a bright, fresh balance. ultimately, a wave of smooth, gently musky woods bring everything together in a soothing, surprisingly cohesive scent that feels like a representation of the Grand Bazaar as a whole. In other words, explore this Labyrinth to your heart's content- we promise you'll find your way to the other side."," Turkish coffee, pineapple, galbanum, tobacco, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, anise, lavender, tonka, cardamom, amber, sandalwood, cedar, vetiver, oakmoss, woody musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ottoman Treasure Extrait de Parfum,2968,Alghabra Parfums," As the center of Sultanic power during the early centuries of the Ottoman Empire, Istanbul's Topkapi Palace is a majestic and sprawling complex, one that could be explored over a lifetime without ever fully revealing its secrets. Ottoman Treasure, the latest from Alghabra, gives this marvelous Palace the tribute it deserves with a rich, complex, compelling oriental scent with plenty of hidden depth of its own. A quick glimpse at the listed notes should give you some sense of what you're in for- there's hardly a traditional top note to be found. Instead, Ottoman Treasure emerges right from the bottle in a hypnotic swirl of smoky white oud and resinous labdanum, lightened only with the gentler smoke of pure olibanum incense and a spicy pop of pink pepper berries. But even with additional notes of earthy patchouli and golden amber in the mix, the composition, like the Palace itself, always leaves space beneath the high-vaulted ceilings for exploration and discovery, as a distinctively mossy basenote keeps overt heaviness at bay despite the powerful richness. Mysterious, regal, intriguing- Ottoman Treasure is everything something seeking a complex yet wearable oriental could ever hope for."," White oud, cistus labdanum, patchouli, olibanum, pink pepper, gurjun balsam, amber, moss, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Royal Sapphire Extrait de Parfum,1226,Thameen," The Imperial State Crown and Sceptre of the United Kingdom, the most precious of the Crown Jewels, share a signature stone- the sapphire. It is the awe-inspiring beauty and resonant depth of this precious, prodigious gemstone that makes up the inspiration for Royal Sapphire, an opulent blend of fruits, florals, and ambered woods that manages to delight and enchant all at once. True to its name, Royal Sapphire opens regal and sparkling, with a stunningly perfect top note of bergamot- sparkling, bright, sophisticated- paired with sweet, juicy mandarin. This mouthwatering duo only increases in potency as a dynamic and lovely orange blossom-led white floral heart adds romantic and regal depth. As a rich amber blends with dry woods in the base, the effect is mesmerising- a fragrance lively and joyful enough to captivate lovers of fruity florals and gourmands, yet as sophisticated as the Crown Jewels themselves. In short- Royal Sapphire is a gem you simply must add to your private collection."," Bergamot, mandarin, orange blossom, jasmine, ambergris, patchouli, moss, amber, dry wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73422.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kintsugi Eau de Parfum,1440,Masque Milano," ""Cherish the simple. Cherish the old. Do not hide your scars, show them with pride.""This simple yet powerful sentiment perfectly captures the ethos behind the ancient Japanese technique of Kintsugi, or Kintsukuroi, which repairs broken pottery using gold-infused lacquer, highlighting instead of obfuscating the cracks and celebrating the beauty and strength of imperfection. With this as inspiration, Masque Milano and perfumer Vanina Muracciole delivers a ""rediscovered"" chypre, pieced back together with a golden vein of suede leather that both restores and reimagines the structure of the style. Traditional elements of bright, bracing bergamot and rich, refined patchouli remain, but oakmoss has been replaced with a salty, savory amber accord that complements the glowing suede heart with an unmistakable fine-grain shimmer. A lovely touch of femininity comes by way of fresh, elegant Grasse rose centifolia and watery magnolia, while the aforementioned patchouli- fractionally distilled to strip away the mustiest aspects- rebalances the composition to sophisticated, unisex bliss. Whether you're a chypre lover looking for a loving reinterpretation, or simply a fan of Masque Milano's elegant yet unpretentious, creator-driven fragrances, Kintsugi is every bit the sparkling treasure its name makes it out to be."," Bergamot, magnolia, amber, suede, rose, violet leaf, benzoin, raspberry leaf, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Osmanthus Elixir Parfum,1480,Ormonde Jayne," While always beautiful, many osmanthus scents carry a hint of melancholy- a trend that Ormonde Jayne's Osmanthus EDP refreshingly sidestepped by creating an osmanthus fragrance bursting with sweet citrus and fresh, crisp florals- a sunlit delight. Osmanthus Elixir knows better than to temper that joyful sensation, and this Parfum does indeed have every bit of the intoxicating citrus pop of the original, meshing with fiery pepper and wild green notes to create a truly ecstatic energy that redefines osmanthus as a floral of brightness and cheer. But the added concentration of the Elixir also allows for a new depth and profundity- a woody, ambered fortitude to the base that provides more richness than the original, all without sacrificing a single ray of sunshine. Sparkling, romantic, and full of joy, Osmanthus Elixir is bliss in a bottle. What We Think All the wonderful brightness and sophisticated, fun florals of the original, with vastly improved longevity and a touch of amber."," Pomelo, davana, pimento, osmanthus, water lily, jasmine, cedar, labdanum, musk, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77756.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Isfarkand Elixir Parfum,2055,Ormonde Jayne," Isfarkand has always had a unique alchemy to its formula- on paper, it's a simple combination of citrus, cedar, and vetiver, and yet there's an abiding magic to how it wears on skin- clean, bright, modern, and transparent, each note blends into those surrounding it to create an enveloping, energizing, modern, and yet supremely easy going potion- a true ""aura"" of stylish and casual panache perfect for almost any situation. Isfarkand Elixir knows not to mess too much with a good thing, but the added Parfum strength gives us a chance to eat our cake and still have it too- while the citrus top still sparkles brightly, a more concentrated cedar note now hums with soft yet potent energy- a rebalance that adds significant longevity and a new layer of complexity in the base. All of style that made you fall in love with Isfarkand the first time, and now even more substance to match. What We Think Still very much the fresh, woodsy, modern Isfarkand we love, with much improved longevity and stronger cedar."," Lime, mandarin, bergamot, iso-e super, cedar, vetiver, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77757.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ta'if Elixir Parfum,1268,Ormonde Jayne," The Ta'if rose- greener, spicier, more vibrant than the lusher European varietals- was the perfect centerpiece to the original Ta'if EDP, where sweet spice and gentle, watery florals defined a light, elegant rose scent with a restrained touch of gourmand exoticism. In Elixir form, however, a dramatic new element emerges with the addition of precious Cambodian oudh, which introduces a rich, warm, animalic sensuality. While it'd be hard to argue that this doesn't add some heaviness to a previously lighter-than-air composition, we urge you to think of Ta'if Elixir as its own, separate fragrance- one where the oudh turns the peppery florals into something sweepingly romantic and thoroughly, three-dimensionally gorgeous. Ta'if Elixir is a scent to be worn with reckless abandon, a breathtaking perfume of tremendous presence and timeless elegance. What We Think Quite different from the airy, subtle Ta'if EDP, and miles apart from a typical rose-oud combination as well. Deep, rich, and authentically warm and animalic."," Pink pepper, saffron, dates, rose, freesia, orange blossom, jasmine, broom, amber, oudh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77758.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Royal Elixir Parfum,1866,Ormonde Jayne," Ambre Royal Eau de Parfum was, and is, a head-turner. From the surprisingly bright green and citrus opening to the sweet and spicy florals, it was a decidedly new kind of amber scent- all of the dreamy indulgence of amber, but none of the heaviness. Royal Elixir doesn't mess with a perfect thing, and so the key notes of Ambre Royal are unaltered- bergamot, jasmine, amber, patchouli. And yet, when concentrated to parfum strength for the Elixir, new heights of complexity are reached- sweet, fresh, warm, and powdery elements intertwine with hypnotic power. And just like that, one of our all time favorite amber scents gets even more unique. What We Think Like the original Ambre Royal, a sophisticated, elegant floral amber- the Elixir concentration brings out the full lushness of the romantic florals and the powdered richness of the tonka and patchouli."," Green notes, orange, bergamot, jasmine, rose, amber, cedar, ambroxan, tonka, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77759.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ormonde Elixir Parfum,1952,Ormonde Jayne," The signature Ormonde Man & Woman eaux de parfum are famous for a reason- featuring a distinctively seductive note of black hemlock, their spicy, aromatic sophistication was, and remains, a breath of fresh air. Now, Ormonde Jayne has taken the shared DNA of both Ormonde Man and Ormonde Woman and produced Ormonde Elixir, a truly stunning, altogether new interpretation. The famed black hemlock is back, along with aromatic cedar and rich cardamom, but in the Elixir, a warm, sensual note of exquisite Cambodian oudh finds alluring, animalic new depth. There's never been a better way to experience the signature of this stunning house. What We Think The distinctive aromatic freshness and spice of Ormonde Man and Ormonde Woman- already quite sexy!- gets an upgrade in both sensuality and sophistication with a perfect complement of warm, strong, just-the-right-amount-of-animalic oudh."," Cardamom, coriander, grass oil, black hemlock, violet, jasmine, cedar, amber, sandalwood, oudh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77760.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Cairo Eau de Parfum,1221,Penhaligons," The sun of an ancient city rising slowly over the citadel, like gold to fill the sky. Now, the early morning murmur of life is about to burst through in a Mediterranean melting-pot home to a thousand minarets and a thousand fragrant gems. This is the aroma of Cairo, a breathtakingly gorgeous new scent from Penhaligon's that blends exotic and modern together in a perfect tribute to a metropolis that has housed both gods and humans for untold millenia. Damascan Rose is macerated in an abundance of woods and spices.

Neroli Intense Eau de Parfum,1601,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," The Queen of Niche, the Queen of French Perfume- there are so many titles one could give to the astoundingly accomplished Patricia de Nicolai, but perhaps her favorite is a simple one: the Queen of Neroli. Indeed, she is an unquestioned master of every facet of the orange tree, from the soothingly fresh blossom to the bitter stem to the juicy fruit, and her mastery is entirely on display in Neroli Intense, which features every aspect of the orange tree- neroli, orange, petitgrain- in a beautifully fresh, lushly floral, utterly intoxicating fragrance. Pittosporum flower enriches the white floral elegance, while beeswax absolute and hints of patchouli and white musk add depth. If you love the classic beauty and freshness of neroli, Neroli Intense is a must try."," Neroli, mandarin, orange, tarragon, pittosporum, petitgrain, patchouli, musk, beeswax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313059.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Brume du Matin Eau de Parfum,1188,Fragrance du Bois," For a house that made its name with rich, vintage-feeling compositions and extraordinary oud, Fragrance du Bois sure does know how to make a delightful fresh scent as well. The latest example is Brume du Matin, a gorgeously delicate summer floral that truly does capture the refreshing bliss of a misty seaside morning. Brume du Matin opens with a perfect evocation of the first rays of sun piercing the marine layer, as mandarin and bergamot shine through a smooth, foglike heart of soft summer florals and juicy but deliberately unsweetened peach and plum. Peony lovers especially should swoon at the lush, playful tones of the floral bouquet, which in turn lead into a gently creamy base of soft woods, amber, and white musk that resonate comfort long after the real fog has given way to summer sunshine.

Cuir de Chine Eau de Parfum,1901,Les Indemodables," In Les IndÃ©modables' Cuir de Chine (”œChinese Leather”), the usually delicate, apricot-faceted osmanthus note is boldly paired with a beautifully fresh and realistic tobacco leaf to create an accord.The result? Delicate yet assertive, classic yet modern, light as spring yet redolent of a tobacconists's leather-and-wood scented atelier, Cuir de Chine is a seamless balancing act of opposites that smoothly draws you into its elegant, romantic world that almost incites visions of sepia-tinted daguerreotype photographed flowers.As Cuir de Chine dries down and continues to bloom on skin, the oscillation between fresh and funky continues apace, as a fatty and indolic jasmine and bright herbal clary sage echo the osmanthus and tobacco leaf pairing to create what almost smells like an aromatic Chinese tea softened with milk, or curiously, even perfume-scented money.There's no doubt everyone's skin will highlight a different aspect of this paradoxical perfume, but one thing is for sure”” it will smell amazing."," Chinese osmanthus absolute 1%, Chinese osmanthus“alcoolat” Grand Cru 10%, Turkish“tabac blond” absolute .2%, Alpine clary sage",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose Millesimee Extrait de Parfum,1859,Jovoy Paris," Powerful yet fresh, sensual yet subtle, Rose Millesimee is an intimate portrait of Centifolia Rose in all of its fresh, spicy splendor. In the talented hands of Vanina Murraciole, this exquisite soliflore is a portrait not only of Grasse's most treasured native flower, but of the region itself, bursting with vivacious natural beauty and deeply romantic effect. A perfect dash of vibrant spice and a sweet, crisp candied apple note enhance the inherent freshness of Centifolia, while a smoothly musky base brings in a touch of Bulgarian rose to supplement the deeper, more carnal floral tones. The result is a true rose soliflore, showcasing the sublime simplicity of letting something naturally luxurious speak for itself. We've been blessed with some incredible rose scents already this year, but Rose Millesimee may well be the best of the bunch."," Clove, candied apple, Centifolia rose, white musks, Bulgarian rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61617.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Cuoio Dei Dolci Eau de Parfum,2911,La Via Del Profumo," Literally translating to ""Sweet Leather,  "" Cuoio dei Dolci is a rare kind of hybrid- one that draws equally from the smoky animalic intensity of leather and the mouthwatering richness of a gourmand to create a perfectly balanced,   exquisitely sensual treasure. This 100% natural confection,   described by none other than Luca Turin as ""a gingerbread ottoman that hits all the buttons,  "" features a heavy dose of castoreum as its primary ingredient- intense,   animalic,   and primally erotic. But lest you worry that Cuoio dei Dolci tilts too far towards the carnal,   a luxurious counterweight of powdered,   vanillic tonka softens the harsh edges,   joining a sweet,   naturalistic tobacco leaf to refine the leather and stir the senses. Supplemental notes of earthy cocoa,   smooth vanilla,   and sweet ylang add to the indulgent sophistication,   while a base of robust,   creamy sandalwood keeps everything at the perfect intersection of the dining room and the smoking parlor. Lovers of sophisticated,   refined,   non-sugary gourmand scents- look no further."," Castoreum, tonka, tobacco, cocoa, mandarin, mysore sandalwood, ylang ylang, vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81611.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Notorious Oud Eau de Parfum,2441,D.S. and Durga," With Notorious Oud,  D.S. & Durga pay tribute to one of the greatest legends to ever emerge from their home borough of Brooklyn- Christopher Wallace,  better known as The Notorious B.I.G. But if you think the inspiration is merely surface level,  you're dead wrong- like the charming,  rough-edged,  impossibly clever rhymes of Frank White himself,  Notorious Oud showcases a versatile and often misunderstood fragrant ingredient with the type of irreverent panache that leaves competitors sputtering like the Madd Rapper. Biggie references aside,  how does Notorious Oud actually smell? Start with the oud itself,  a rich Indonesian specimen (""smell the Indonesia, "" as the great man once rapped) with a robust balance of smoky,  earthy,  and animalic tones. Afghani saffron and white galbanum enhance the green,  spicy energy,  while a lush Bulgarian rose feels as smooth and suave as Big Poppa. We could go on,  but we'll leave you instead with one last Biggie quote to capture how we feel about Notorious Oud: ""Stay far from timid/only make moves when your heart's in it/and live the phrase sky's the limit..."""," Saffron, camphor, white galbanum, oud, rose, lavender, civet, cetalox, papyrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/686084.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

A high-shine armor of addictive aldehydes envelop its reverberating core of sensuous white flowers, like a metal Venus in fleurs.Like an armored embroidered dress, the metallic sheath of lighter-than-air aldehydes opens the scent like a second skin, the collision of crisp vert de bergamote and pink peppercorn further steeling the insatiability of the first impression.Beneath its cool veneer, Metallique's floral heart is amplified by juxtaposing delicate white blossoms of aubepine and muguet with the narcotic-like nectar of heliotrope.An aura of ambrette seed imparts warmth with woody inflections of Peru balsam.

Fougere Emeraude Eau de Parfum,2307,Les Indemodables," A tuberose fougÃ¨re. That's not something you hear about every day, but once you smell it in FougÃ¨re Emeraude, it seems like the perfect way to both highlight and steer this floral note in an interesting direction that deconstructs the gender categories a floral or a fougÃ¨re would ordinarily suggest.But if you love tuberose, don't worry, FougÃ¨re Emeraude hands it to you in a hefty 15 percent dose, with all of its sweet creaminess and subtle green accents. No waiting in the wings for this one””it gets right down to business at first sniff.

Gentle fluidity Silver Eau de Parfum,2390,Maison Francis Kurkdjian," Gentle fluidity – note the small f – is part of perfumer Francis Kurkdjian's experiment to see what happens when you set out with an identical set of notes but head off in two separate directions. The result? A complementary (but utterly different) pair of fragrances - gentle Fluidity (Gold) and Gentle fluidity (Silver) – that prove that a painter's palette is just a starting point and that the magic only happens when the painter picks up his brush. Two distinct forms emerge from the master's art – one for him and one for her. Both sharing the same DNA.Gentle fluidity (Silver) is the fresher of this charming duo. Immediately, the fresh gin-and-tonic fizz of juniper berry dominates, followed closely by a spiced woody note that's not quite as sharp as pine but still redolent of the cool, aromatic aroma of a coniferous forest. The coriander lends a metallic, peppery sheen to the woods that lifts the ashy greenness of the traditional fougÃ¨re-like accord in the heart and modernizes it for the young professional we see this fitting to a T. Crisp, fresh, and with a certain champagne-like sparkle that connects the dots to its warmer, richer Gold counterpart, Gentle fluidity (Silver) is the kind of scent you can dress up with a white shirt and tie, or dress down in khakis, and it will never be less than perfect."," Juniper, nutmeg, coriander, musk, amber, woods, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49887.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The result? A complementary (but utterly different) pair of fragrances - gentle Fluidity (Gold) and Gentle fluidity (Silver) – that prove that a painter's palette is just a starting point and that the magic only happens when the painter picks up his brush. Two distinct forms emerge from the master's art – one for him and one for her. Both sharing the same DNA.gentle Fluidity (Gold) is the richer, more indulgent counterpart in the series. The sharp, aromatic freshness of the juniper and coriander of Gentle fluidity (Silver) has been dialed right back to allow the lush, almost syrupy vanilla-amber pairing take center stage, filling the air with its assertively sweet creaminess. The spice in gentle Fluidity is subtle but noticeable, the coriander berry in particular lending a gently champagne-like fizz that lifts the sultry vanilla pudding accord and gives it a metallic sparkle. Warm, sensuous, and as cozy as a cat on a lap, gentle Fluidity (Gold) is just the kind of thing you need when the world is all sharp angles and hard elbows."," Juniper, nutmeg, coriander, musk, amber, woods, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49888.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oriental Velours Eau de Parfum,1515,Les Indemodables," Oriental Velours is as plush as its name suggests, plunging you into a hypnotic reverie of warm, spicy resins, creamy vanilla, and aromatic notes recalling bracing woods and pine needles. Its centerpiece is myrrh, with its woody, subtle licorice facet which finds resonance with vanilla and what smells like a hint of cinnamon. Although the church incense quality of myrrh isn't overdone here, there's certainly enough to subliminally suggest rituals and to possibly incite devotion at its perfumed altar.An almost smoky vetiver pulls the warm notes of Oriental Velours together with its brightness and elegance, adding some lightness to the otherwise nocturnal character of this fragrance. Like all of the fragrances in Les IndÃ©modables' collection, there's a seamless melding together of notes in Oriental Velours that quietly draws you in with its mysterious beauty."," Indian jasmine alcoolat “Grand Cru” 5%, Madagascan vanilla “Grand Cru” 2.5%, Somalian myrrh 15%, Haitian vetiver“Grand Cru” 10%, Alpine spruce oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Musk Cologne Eau de Parfum,2060,Bortnikoff," When you have access to raw materials as exceptionally high quality as those used in Bortnikoff scents, the word ""cologne"" should never be mistaken to mean a fragrance is light or fleeting. Instead, it's an invitation to discover the tremendous amount of depth that the traditionally fresh style can contain- something we first learned with their ambergris-laden Amber Cologne. But Musk Cologne is something else altogether, an arresting combination of vibrant citrus, smooth florals, and rich, warm musk that thrums with sensual energy that simply must be experienced to be believed. Gently spicy, subtly smoky, and compellingly animalic, this is a musk note of remarkable sophistication, so striking that it upends the staid expectations for an eau-de-cologne style fragrance and reinvents it as something potent and seductive, even while maintaining a cheerful and energetic exterior. Or to put it another way- you've never smelled a cologne quite like this."," Bergamot, lemon, tangerine, sweet orange, green tea, lily of the valley, magnolia, tuberose, ylang ylang, deer musk, sandalwood, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mandarino di Sicilia Eau de Parfum,1400,Perris Monte Carlo," With so many wonderful new citrus fragrances available this summer, what makes Mandarino di Sicilia stand out from the crowd? The answer might sound silly but, well- it's the mandarin. Specifically, three unique fractional essential oils of mandarin- delicate, nuanced green mandarin, rich, juicy yellow mandarin, and a third distillation capturing a bitter, bracing orange essence. The result is a dazzling portrait of citrus in full, further enhanced with petitgrain and orange blossom, and given form and weight with fruity amber and a dashing note of geranium. Fresh, bright, and sophisticated, Mandarino di Sicilia is a burst of citrus sunshine for even the most discerning tastes."," Green mandarin, bitter orange, yellow mandarin, petitgrain, Jasmin, geranium, orange blossom, cedar, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/702051.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bergamotto di Calabria Eau de Parfum,2650,Perris Monte Carlo," The oldest and most revered method for extracting Calabrian bergamot oil is performed by hand using a specially curved knife and a natural sponge. It's a painstaking process, requiring 200kg of fruit for a single litre of essential oil, and thus it is rarely employed today, but it sidesteps the quality control issues inherent in mechanical extraction to produce a fragrant essence of the most delicate, complex quality, a perfect blend of tart, juicy freshness and smooth, sophisticated floral tones. It's this uniquely exceptional bergamot that defines the character of Bergamotto di Calabria, supplemented with a fiery jolt of ban timur and pink peppers, smoothed with a delicate white floral heart, and given warm, creamy depth with a musky sandalwood base. It's the absolute best that the old ways have to offer, made exceptional with just a touch of the new."," Bergamot, petitgrain, timur pepper, pink pepper, orange flower, neroli, orange blossom, jasmine, iris, sandalwood, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/702052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Arancia di Sicilia Eau de Parfum,2684,Perris Monte Carlo," In perfumery the essential oil from bitter oranges carries greater value than that of more common sweeter varieties. The Sanguinella Orange is the exception to the rule due to its exceptionally high quality. Cultivated on the slopes of Mount Etna, the fruit grown here stands out due to its intense red color and complex, aromatic sweetness. In Arancia di Sicilia, the pure essence of this dynamic citrus is brought to life through two laborious manual extraction processes whose oils are blended together to produce an accord which fuses the energy and character of citrus with an enveloping natural sweetness. The scent's heart is enhanced with almond, vanilla and cinnamon, followed by base notes revealing soft musk and amber, and then finally the intense aroma of coffee absolute. Arancia Di Sicilia celebrates the flavors and scents of Sicily, creating the warm atmosphere of Sicilian mornings, the flavor of invigorating orange juice and the sweetness of pure candy- a tribute to the island and a delight for the senses."," Blood orange (brown extraction & sfuma torchio extraction), almond, cinnamon, labdanum, coffee, iris, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/702053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Soleil d'Italie Eau de Parfum,1942,Mancera," Spicy, sexy, and blissfully sunny, Soleil d'Italie is a delightful romp across the Italian coastline.

Safran Colognise Extrait de Cologne,2933,Nishane," Since its debut last year, Nishane's Colognise- a lovely and invigorating re-imagining of the fresh lemon cologne kept on-hand in most Turkish households- has been an office favorite, a striking yet casual scent perfect for any situation. Now, with Safran Colognise, they've brought back the core of the fragrance with a pronounced dash of fiery saffron, and the result is strikingly unique- a fragrance with the delightful energy of the original, but a robust, exotic character all its own. Safran Colognise's bright, citrussy opening will be familiar to fans of the original, but it arrives right away with a twist all its own- the tropical juiciness of passionfruit, which helps open the palate to the rich spiciness of saffron, combined with pink pepper for a powerful heart that maintains an airy freshness- less herbaceous than its predecessor but still recognizable and bright. A drydown that adds salty ambergris and leather to the mix preserves the spicy power, while also adding some additional longevity to the musky formula of the original. Robust and vivacious, Safran Colognise is an intoxicating new take on a classic."," Cedrat, passion fruit, pink grapefruit, saffron, magnolia, pink pepper, musk, ambergris, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774057.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Le Chant de Camargue Eau de Parfum,1563,L'Artisan Parfumeur," The desalinated marshes of the Camargue region of France are known for the treasured ""wild"" red rice cultivated there- and the gorgeous pink flamingos drawn to the amber-colored plants. Le Chant de Camargue, the newest from L'Artisan and perfumer Alberto Morillas, captures the unique character of this magical location, delivering a subtle and beautiful fragrance  that evokes the delicately floral, subtly earthy, soothingly creamy aromas one might experience on a stroll through a real rice paddy. Using the fresh. gently smoky tones of bergamot to set the scene, Le Chant de Camargue quickly reveals a smoothly powdery heart of rice, an accord built from scratch by Morillas to capture the uniquely nutty texture of Camargue red rice. The rice's mouthwateringly milky tones are further supplemented with the sandalwood milk accord of the base, prolonging the woody and creamy elements of the rice and bringing the intensity of the still-noticeable bergamote back into play. The cumulative effect is compellingly dreamlike, delicately mouthwatering, and subtly invigorating- a true journey through a beautiful and distinctive corner of France as only L'Artisan could provide."," Bergamot, Carmargue rice, sandalwood milk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152026.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Bright, luscious citrus meld into an exotic bouquet of jasmine, rose, and violet, invigorated by savory notes of saffron and caraway that sparkle like a warm summer day. In a deep, musky base, creamy sandalwood lends a velvet touch, while a deliciously resinous olibanum incense note gives us a brush with the mystical. As with any good dream, Petales de Cashmere has no sharp edges, each delightful note existing instead in complete harmony, the feeling of almost primal well-being lingering for hours on the skin.

A Man's Cologne Eau de Parfum,1461,Gravel," There are fragrances that are defined by their era, and then there are fragrances that outlast their own era and become immortal. Gravel is just such a fragrance. Originally invented by Michael Knudsen in 1957, Gravel A Man's Cologne was a different sort of men's scent right from the start- sold exclusively at select boutiques and featuring a distinctive profile- fresh, fruity citrus that transitions into a never-too-heavy blend of balsamic woody notes. The base blends powdery tonka, a secret selection of spices, and a mineralic, lightly industrial aura of incense and vetiver that does indeed call to mind the name of the fragrance- and yes, those are real pieces of gravel in the bottle, perhaps imbuing their own unique character over time. The result is a scent that we'd imagine has the exact same balance of elegant classicism and sexy modernity in 2019 as it did more than half a century ago. Gravel A Man's Cologne is, by any standard, a legendary scent. Who couldn't use one of those in their life?"," Bergamot, orange, patchouli, tonka bean, benzoin, incense, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/829000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Villa Nellcote Eau de Parfum,2280,19-69," ""Never has a house been so closely associated with the creation of a rock album. This was a summer that would change the history of music forever. The fragrance Villa Nellcote is the embodiment of the magnificent garden and surroundings at the estate with the same name."" -Johan Bergelin Villa Nellcote, a 19th-century mansion overlooking Villefranche Bay on France's Cote d'Azur, has what could generously be called a colorful past- after serving as a Gestapo headquarters during the Nazi occupation of France, the Villa was reclaimed for ""allied"" debauchery when it was famously rented in the summer of 1971 to serve as the party palace and studio of the Rolling Stones as they recorded their classic album Exile On Main Street. Using the lushly landscaped grounds as an inspiration, Villa Nellcote the fragrance is a smooth, confident unisex floral, boasting a bouquet of lush flowers enriched with a piquant blend of fresh green citrus and spice. We picture ourselves atop the grand outdoor staircase overlooking the lavish gardens, with a subtly smoky base of black tea, patchouli and woods the only indication of the rock-star hedonism happening in the cellar-turned-studio, hidden away from prying eyes. For those who like their summertime freshness with just a hint of naughtiness, Villa Nellcote is a perfect tribute to a locale that will forever live in rock-n-roll infamy."," Grapefruit, bergamot, petitgrain, pink pepper, elemi, lemon, lemon flower, violet, rose, jasmine, magnolia, osmanthus, black tea, cabreuva, cedar, patchouli, white amber, musk, moss, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Portrayal Man Eau de Parfum,2306,Amouage," The fifth chapter of the cycle of the Amouage narrative, Portrayal is a manifestation of a person's orientation to himself. A reflection of his unique authenticity, it is about breaking free from the cages of solitude society set around people because their truths are often seen as shockingly unconventional.Portrayal embodies an artist's ability to reconnect fragments from different times and places. When society is barren, they are able to transport themselves and immerse in the freedom of rebellion that can compare to London's Roaring 1920's and New York's grooving 1980's. With the flamboyant, glamorous and often disaffected companionship of Bright Young People, the artists lose themselves. It is an olfactive depiction of bohemian culture. Its woody and leather aroma exudes an air of exquisite audacity. It is about the arrogance and social tension in the world's cultural discourse. With Vetiver at its heart and top notes of Violet Leaves, Portrayal Man emits a dandy yet masculine impression."," Violet Leaves, Vetiver, Cade",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/418095.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Musc des Sables Eau de Parfum,1850,Les Indemodables," What do you get when you combine two of the costliest ingredients in perfumery””ambergris and orris””with animalic musks and spices? In Antoine Lie's hands, a mysteriously sexy elixir that melts into skin, leaving a sheer but substantial trace of fairy dust that's subtly sweet, spicy, sensuous, and ever-evolving.Musc des Sables opens with a fresh, bright mandarin note that seamlessly transitions into cozy, spiced opulence. Ambergris in contemporary, even luxury perfumes, is mostly synthetic due to its price and scarcity, but the ambergris at Musc des Sables' heart””tinctured from authentic ambre gris (grey amber) through a 6-month process done specifically for Les IndÃ©modables at its founders' lab””pulsates with sensuality and complexity. Anyone who's smelled this classical perfume ingredient in its authentic form in vintage or bespoke formulas will recognize it here as the real deal for its earthy, animalic and even tabacco-like warmth that leaves its trace hours into wearing it. Combined with creamy orris, spices, patchouli and musk, Musc des Sables' heady formula somehow maintains a diaphanous””yet persistent”” lightness.

Iris Perle Eau de Parfum,1978,Les Indemodables," Like some beautiful faces so gorgeous you're not sure what feature to pay attention to first, the elegant Iris Perle is an embarrassment of riches.Perhaps the first thing you notice is coolness, as if elegance turned itself into silk, shimmering in the light. The multifaceted mimosa bloom, so fresh and representative of that honeyed floral you'd think its scent was radiating from under your nose by the warmth of the sun, combines with sultry jasmine and bright ylang-ylang. Maybe the violet leaves or clary sage that keep the composition fresh catch your attention first, or the huge amount of the most expensive perfume ingredient in the world””orris, the sensual backdrop to Iris Perle that is at once earthy, cool, sensual, and creamy.Whatever it is you notice first, or all at once, these are not ordinary ingredients. They're the Platonic Ideal, whose journey from plant to bottle was ushered with experience and care by their founders. The Moroccan mimosa absolute in Iris Perle is extracted in their lab from carefully hand-selected flower buds only, whereas the entire flower and stem is usually used in other perfumes with mimosa notes. This accounts for its smooth, rich floralcy that edits out unwanted herbaceous qualities. And from the time it's planted until it's extracted, it takes seven years for orris root to deliver its oil, like a pearl in the world of perfumery. Iris Perle gets its French orris from“grand cru” crops exclusive to Les IndÃ©modables.Antoine Lie has wrested from all of these superior ingredients their most singing and luscious qualities, leaving for the dramatic backdrop a kind of textural perfume: rich, buttery, gleaming, and smooth, like an iridescent pearl."," French orris absolute grand cru, Morrocan mimosa absolute, Indian jasmine absolute, Madagascan ylang-ylang, Clary sage from the Alps",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose de Jamal Eau de Parfum,1046,Les Indemodables," Rose de Jamal asks you to rethink this iconic perfume note,  long consigned in the mainstream perfume imagination as something stodgy,  old fashioned,  and too conventionally feminine. And one whiff of it will have you feeling,  to borrow a song lyric,  like a perfume virgin,  sniffing rose as if for the very first time. Its avant-garde construction by perfumer Antoine Lie takes the Moroccan damascena rose absolute at its heart far away from its classical use,  thanks largely to its pairing with a special Moroccan“Naneh” mint,  a variety of spearmint especially sweet and aromatic and used in Moroccan drinks and teas. Although this mint might move Rose de Jamal toward a“masculine” fougÃ¨re,  it perhaps ideally helps to deconstruct any ingrained ideas of gender in rose,  producing only the more perfume-centric thought,  This is beautiful.Rose de Jamal is also unusual for its massive 5.5% dose of Moroccan rose absolute. In addition there are 500 grams of freshly harvested rose buds per bottle of Rose de Jamal ”” the equivalent of more than 100 roses. Smelling Rose de Jamal might also produce the feeling of smelling rose for the very first time,  Lie has suggested in interviews,  because its realness is radically different from the scent of synthetically constructed rose accords in most perfumes with rose. The rose here is lush,  velvety,  almost suede-like,  subliminally pulling you into its mysterious heart even as you might only be smelling its lush beauty. What also makes Rose de Jamal special is its name: named after the Les IndÃ©modable exclusive partner in Morocco,  Jamal Chaboun,  who produces this special Rose harvest (among other ingredients). Jamal owns his plantations,  controls the crops,  and has mastered extraction processes.”œJamal loves his business and is very proud of his raw materials, ” Lie said in an interview.“We decided to make a perfume homage to the gentleman,  to take him from the shadows.”"," Moroccan damascene rose absolute, Moroccan cedarwood, Madagascan pink pepper C02, Morocan Naneh mint, lavender",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pineapple Essenza Eau de Parfum,2997,Panah London," If the word pineapple makes you feel like you know what's coming, let us assure you- Pineapple Essenza isn't another Aventus clone. Instead, it's a fizzy, fruity, woodsy delight of a unisex cocktail, a dose of flirtatious summertime fun that lovers of unique freshies should take care not to miss. Pineapple Essenza opens with- you guessed it- pineapple, in this instance a note that plays with both the sweet and tart aspects of the fruit, enhanced with a jolt of icy Sicilian lemon and a tangy twist of blackcurrant, giving it chypre-like aromatic qualities without sacrificing an ounce of refreshment. A gently sweet tonka note leads into a smoothly musky-woodsy base, deepening the sophisticated yet straightforward character and ensuring enough depth to make this tropical delight a year-round go-to. Let go of your preconceptions and dive into Pineapple Essenza- thank us for the smile you can't get rid of later."," Pineapple, Sicilian lemon, blackcurrant, lily, tonka, patchouli, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/828002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Brandied Pear Eau de Parfum,1446,Panah London," Panah has quickly gained our attention for scents that effortlessly balance delectable gourmand elements with an everyday wearable lightness, and Brandied Pear may be the best of the bunch. Boasting a succulent, refreshing fruitiness to offset the dessert's decadent construction, this is less a gourmand, and more a fruit-forward delight with just enough vanillic sweetness to leave us swooning. The central player is, we're happy to confirm, the pear- mouthwatering, gently spiced, and sweetened not with syrupy sugar but rather just a touch of ripe banana. Only after we've had some time to exult in this perfect pear does it get the after-dinner treatment- a simmer in rich, warm, boozy brandy and a drizzle of indulgent vanilla cream. All the while, zesty lemon, verdant green leaves, and a wisp of soft musk keep things fresh and not too sweet, ensuring its unisex appeal. Pear lovers, this one's calling your name- don't miss out."," Lemon, banana, pear, green leaves, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/828004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nefs Extrait de Parfum,2070,Nishane," Like Istanbul itself, the masterful creations of Nishane straddle the line between Europe and Asia, synthesizing the palettes and traditions of both in the service of dynamic, modern perfumery. And so it's unsurprising that Nefs, conceptualized as the line's flagship oriental scent, wouldn't be content to simply recycle the genre's standard spicy floral opulence, but would instead strive for a new, modern oriental- an East-meets-West portrait of refined luxury to sway even those who dislike oriental fragrances.  Keep in mind that when we say luxurious, we mean it- this is Nishane's most indulgently constructed fragrance yet, with authentic aged oud, exquisite harvests of rose, jasmine, and osmanthus, and a vibrant, saffron-led spice bouquet. Gently sweetened with honey and the balanced booziness of whiskey, the florals and spice stay lively on the skin, subverting any associations of oriental scents with oppressive heaviness or vintage stuffiness. A rich, smooth, gently gourmand woodsy base adds a sensual touch of modernity. Like a breeze blowing from the east across the Bosporus, Nefs is an exquisite oriental that bridges the gap between civilizations."," Honey, violet, sage, saffron, fig, rose, osmanthus, geranium, jasmine, nutmeg, amber, whiskey, oud, cinnamon, cedar, gurjam balsam, leather, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774056.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Megamare Parfum,1714,Orto Parisi," A portrait of the beauty that lies on the surface of the ocean, and the dangers of the salty depths below. Megamare is a swirling typhoon of a scent, a heady wash of brackish water, biting green algae, spicy-sweet sea air, and a sparkling musk that radiates with the intensity of the midday sun reflecting off the rolling waves of the open ocean. With immense longevity and powerful projection. Tranquil and terrifying, serene and sensual, Megamare radiates the yin and yang of the sea.","Spicy, Sweet, Sparkling Musk, Oceany",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67707.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mahabah Eau de Parfum,1575,ANFAS," Mahaba, meaning“love” but also“charity” in Arabic, is a unique floriental composition that conveys youthful innocence and lusty warmth in one breath. A bight candied lemon topnote yields to a startling ylang note that balances its usual impression of fruity, lush tropicalia with an undertone of leathery licorice or rubber. In the background, a sultry combination of vanilla and tonka bean creates a buff, creamy accent, like a bitter almond horchata dusted with candied aniseed sprinkles. Mahaba is gorgeously creamy but never too sweet, with something of the same licorice-and-coffee woodiness that lends Un Bois Vanille (Serge Lutens) its mysterious darkness. Later on, towards the final drydown, a striking note of salt or brine lurking in the wings pops out to create the curious effect of flowers mixed with a creamy, anisic milk and melon rind thickly encrusted with sea salt. Feminine, lovely, and unusual, Mahaba is a floral oriental tailor-made for those moments when you want your scent to convey a certain youthful sweetness but also a little twist that keeps people guessing."," petitgrain, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Shaghaf Eau de Parfum,2710,ANFAS," Shaghaf, meaning passion or sensual desire in Arabic, is, for us, the jewel in the Anfas crown. The simplest way to describe it would be to say that it smells exactly like walking into a centuries-old majlis – a huge, carpeted room for receiving honored guests or conducting parliamentary business – in the heart of a Middle Eastern city. Shaghaf smells like old wood and textiles that have long absorbed the lusty aromas of burning oud wood, the preparation of tea and coffee boiled with cardamom and cloves, and the smoky sweetness of a million assorted grades of bakhoor seeping into hair, wool, and fur, and is now releasing them into the air, with a sigh.Shaghaf opens with a wave of thrillingly exotic notes, crested by a funky-smoky oud note that's been made even grimier with a lusty ginger and cardamom underlining. The spiced oud accord is like a beastly shadow that creeps along the walls along the Ka'aba, its presence dark and ever-present. But soon, all you notice is the heart of magnificently dry oud wood smoldering in the heat of the embers, peppered with chunks of amber resin and glittering with incense. Slowly, a worn leather note emerges – or maybe it is black tea – thick with a meaty stew of resin and spice. Shaghaf is a very dry but very rich perfume, a microcosm of everything we imagine the Middle East to smell like. But for all its husky desiccation, this is a wonderfully warm and inviting scent. With its toasty, sandy texture, Shaghaf occupies the same headspace as Fidelis (by Histoires de Parfum), Nanban (Arquiste), and Songe d'Un Bois en EtÃ© (Guerlain) but is much softer and smoother, with no harsh woody buzz around the edges. Silage and longevity are as monumental as the scent itself, but Shaghaf is the rare beastmode oriental that actually gets better and more interesting the longer it's on your skin. With the heat of your skin to get it going, the scent seems to expand and radiate off the skin in big, red-gold waves of aroma, undulating in richness and saturation. Color us impressed – this bad boy is a Muezzin's call to prayer in scent form, but there's nothing holy about it."," cardamom, ginger, citruses, leather, tobacco, cedar, cashmeran, patchouli, agarwood (oud), amber, vanilla, tolu balsam, opoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Red Ishq Eau de Parfum,1402,ANFAS,"“I cannot describe the moment your name is mentioned and I cannot express my love for you. You are me, I move with you”. Red ISHQ is perfumer Asim Al Qassim's vision of the yin and yang of true love, the bittersweet sacrifice of submission balanced against the enveloping warmth of unconditional love. Accordingly, the initial burst of leathery saffron – dry, slightly bitter – is softened by a luscious raspberry and a cloud of rosy talc. Think Tuscan Leather's buttery suede jacket dusted with fuchsia-colored powder.Oakmoss takes the reins in the drydown, its distinctive aroma of dried sea lichen, marine ink, and sea grass giving the scent an interesting salty dryness that nevertheless stays firmly rooted in the leather genre rather than chypre. The drydown of Red ISHQ features a smoky ashy fir balsam note that paints a parallel between the balsamic freshness of Encens Flamboyant (Annick Goutal) and the abstract, crushed-ruby balminess of Baccarat Rouge (Maison Francis Kurkdijan). Despite the pert raspberry note up front, Red ISHQ is completely unisex – a uniquely fresh-but-rich saffron suede with a unami-ish bite that will make your mouth water."," jasmine, saffron, raspberry, amber, oakmoss, talc",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Green Gaya Eau de Parfum,2126,ANFAS," Bright, fresh, and unashamedly cheerful, Green Gaya whisks us on a journey to a true oasis, where its bounty of succulent fruit and spicy woods is all the richer for the vastness of the desert that surrounds it. Picture an exotic dessert, created from the ripest, juiciest fruits a kingdom could produce- sticky, mouthwatering mango and plump, smooth, gently floral pear, enhanced with a daring dose of sweet cardamom and rich star anise. A delectably creamy milk heart heightens the gourmand delicacy, while a balancing accord of crisp, stout cedarwood and a gentle touch of oud cut through the sweet and creamy notes to provide energy and structure. A warm amber base paired with dry iris suggests the stifling heat just outside of our hideaway, heightening the contrast and enhancing the refreshing vitality."," Anise, cardamom, mango, pear, cedar, milk, liquorice, oud, amber, wood, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Purple Sakan,1068,ANFAS," Purple Sakan is a fragrance dedicated to nostalgia, and to the power that scent has to evoke not only a memory of an event, but of the distinctive emotional and sensory tableau of our most treasured moments. It is a wonder, an impressively spicy oriental that hides impressive complexity behind its subtle and agreeable facade of smooth amber. But as Purple Sakan develops and grows, the vibrance grows by leaps and bounds- earthy, green cardamom leaps from the skin, propelled by bright, dry citrus. Rich, savory coffee and cumin complement the creamy vanilla of the base, while other basenotes of sweet, earthy patchouli and clean musk let the spices continue to sing. Purple Sakan may be a specific reference to the nostalgia of Asim al Qassim's Emirati upbringing and the unique flavors and smells of an Arab kitchen, but the warmth and comfort infused in every drop of this magical elixir is universal."," Bergamot, cardamom, lemon, orange, amber, coffee, cumin, musk, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gold Watan Eau de Parfum,1940,ANFAS," ""A story written with golden water... a history that cannot be erased...""Inspired by the feeling of pure luxury conveyed by both pure gold and pure oud, Gold Watan is a shimmering vision of romance and exoticism. From the first spray, its royal lineage is clear, as the top notes feature a rich, resinous, potent oud and cistus combination usually reserved for a scent's latter phases. In this instance, however, it proves the perfect introduction- powerfully evocative, yet so well balanced that the subtly sweet and smoky tones have room to shift and move, leading into an exuberant heart of woodsy, spicy nagarmotha and a smooth, multi-colored floral accord that adds softness to the oud's pungent authenticity. Pillowy musk and the perfect amount of mouthwatering, crystalline sugar complete the intriguingly parallel evolution of the scent, as the progression from rugged to refined happens with such designed subtlety that you may not realize quite what's happened until you find that you simply cannot stop sniffing your wrist. Sumptuous and authentic, yet delicious and delightful, Gold Watan is an unforgettable oud fragrance."," Cistus, oud, nagarmotha, floral notes, musk, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rahaba Eau de Parfum,2903,ANFAS," Rahaba is the Arabic word for openness, especially the openness required of a host. In Arab culture, the role of host is taken very seriously – and Rahaba is a scent that reflects the generosity of spirit required. It opens with a beguiling mixture of fresh and dried pineapple, mimicking the tray of sweetmeats typically offered to you upon arrival. A fizzy lemonade note injects the scent with ferocious sparkle and joie de vivre. There is a touch of gin, too – but it's more a fresh, outdoorsy juniper note than anything truly boozy. This barrage of vibrant, fruity, and fizzy notes are the interlude to a soft and restful bouquet of rose, which, lightly dusted with iris, lends a discreetly powdery texture to the scent. However, like a host who welcomes everyone with equal grace, both men and women alike will find Rahaba tremendously inviting. The bright candied pineapple and floral notes fade away slowly over a blond, freshly-cut woody accord that maintains the scent's sparkling feel. The drydown is curiously airy and salty, a nutty tonka bean holding it all together at the spine. Rahaba is, in its final hours, a mÃ©lange of tart fruity notes grafted onto a hugely spacious ambery musk – perhaps Ambrox – that expands the scent to room-filling proportions without losing any of its delicacy."," orange, gin, pineapple, Damask rose, Grasse rose, orris, tonka bean, sandalwood, vanilla, amber, almond, tolu balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Samaha,2209,ANFAS," Samaha, meaning tolerance and magnanimity in Arabic, is a modern Venus on a Half Shell. Picture a bosomy bouquet of freshly-cut flowers emerging from a fine misting of sea spray, and then wrapped in a cloud of soapy floral musks and the steamy vapors of feminine bathing rituals. Like its antecedents, Amouage Gold or Madame Rochas, Samaha is a classically feminine scent that manages to be refined and faintly suggestive at the same time. Flirting with the line between freshly-scrubbed and richly suggestive, it channels the classic triad of Grasse-grown jasmine, rose, and neroli through the red velvet corridor of a Parisian boudoir. There are no aldehydes here, nothing fusty or old-fashioned, and yet its perfumey cloud of abstract flowers and bathroomy musks clearly draws on a French tradition of perfumery. The key difference is the salty, lemony radiance that suffuses the structure with air and light – Samaha is full-bodied, but light, like the fluffiest floral lemon chiffon cake you can imagine."," citruses, sea notes, jasmine, neroli, rosebay willowherb, rose, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sa'adah Eau de Parfum,1736,ANFAS," Sa'adah is an Arabic name for girls that means ”˜happiness'. And indeed, this scent holds true to that inspiration. Opening with a bright, fresh candied orange note over a bed of violets and rose, the scent quickly establishes itself as a mood board of good vibes. Soft but vibrant pine and cedar notes lend the perky florals a touch of woody sourness, keeping the scent on an even keel. We see Sa'adah appealing to young women who like their flowers abstract rather than literal; the bouquet of flowers here is blurred, giving off only an impression of bright, candied freshness, and later on, when a voluptuous ylang enters the picture, a buttery richness. Crucially, though, Sa'adah smells clean and modern, with no aldehydes or powder to ”˜age' it. It is a happy, bright floral cut free of any association to floral perfumery of the past. A warm, resiny tonka and vanilla base wraps the florals up in a softly caramelized brown sugar haze that, while sweet, won't give anyone toothache. A happy floral for an upbeat sort of gal."," orange, rose, pine, neroli, violet, cedar, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Velvet Splendour Perfume Concentrate,1011,Goldfield & Banks," We absolutely adore mimosa-based scents, so when word arrived that the newest Goldfield & Banks would feature golden wattle, or Australian mimosa, we were delighted. But what we never could have anticipated is just how uniquely different from European mimosa golden wattle turns out to be- powdery and woodsy, with gentle tones of green fruit, this is a hearty and distinctive floral note all its own- one that truly captures the rugged beauty of the Flinders Ranges in Southern Australia where the wattle used in this fragrance is harvested. As Goldfield & Banks is so adept at accomplishing, every supplemental ingredient in this cheerfully complex floral brings out a new aspect of the golden wattle- bright, fresh mandarin, smooth orange blossom and jasmine, and soft, gently earthy woods produce a refined naturalism. If you're a mimosa lover looking for something you've never quite tried before, or if you're simply seeking a gorgeous and unique floral perfect for any occasion, Velvet Splendour is ray of warm sunshine."," Mandarin, hedione, mimosa absolute (South Australia), orange blossom, jasmin sambac, Australian sandalwood, patchouli, Haitian vetiver, leather, tonka, oppoponax, heliotropine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79507.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Papyrus Oud Eau de Parfum,2923,Parle Moi de Parfum," In 2003, Michel Almairac released the instantly iconic Gucci pour Homme, a boldly warm and woodsy men's scent featuring a proprietary ""papyrus wood"" accord that defied the fresh, synthetic trends of the time to become a modern classic. Now, almost two decades later, Almairac returns to his beloved creation through a niche fragrance lens- with an emphasis on smoky, spicy complexity- and the result is Papyrus Oud, a vision of masculine elegance and warm sophistication.The key to Papyrus Oud's timeless appeal is evident in the east-meets-west nature of its composition, with classically French floral and aromatic notes of lavender, geranium, oakmoss and jasmine injecting vibrant elegance into the luxuriously Middle Eastern melange of fiery spice, papyrus, agarwood, and incense. The result is a scent that feels full but never heavy, distinctive but smooth and surprisingly easy to wear- a true signature scent that, while leaning masculine, smells out-of-this-world good on just about anyone. Whether you've long missed Gucci pour Homme or are simply looking for something that casts aside the trends of the day for something better, Papyrus Oud is a gift from above."," Papyrus, Incense, Patchouli, Oud, Musk, Chocolate, Ginger",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76712.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gardens of India Eau de Parfum,1369,Parle Moi de Parfum," Some fragrances achieve sophistication via complex arrangements of dozens or even hundreds of notes; others, however, know that a simply perfect ratio of a few simply perfect materials has the same capacity to astound. It's this latter philosophy that guides Gardens of India, a deeply romantic scent that deploys three wonderful ingredients- jasmine, tuberose, and sandalwood- to magnificent and unforgettable effect. As basic as the notes list may be, the astonishing balance of Gardens of India is a tribute to the over twenty years that master perfumer Michel Almairac spent refining the formula. It begins with jasmine buds, plucked in June and allowed to hatch before extracting their scent, in order to extract both lush white floral notes and a bright, dewey greenness. Tuberose is harvested in early autumn when the blooms are full, preserving the intense carnality and sweet richness of the majestic flower. Finally, the sandalwood, distilled to rich, woodsy, creamy perfection. The scent is romantic, full-bodied, and invigorating- everything a woodsy floral can and should be. Take a walk through the Gardens of India- we think you'll be surprised at how much you find waiting there."," Jasmine, tuberose, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76713.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blackpepper Eau de Parfum,2183,Comme des Garcons," Blackpepper is the pitch black of a starless sky rendered into perfume form. A perfect storm of“black” flavor molecules clash as if in a Super Collider – pungent black pepper, charred cedar, and smoky Akigala wood sparking off against each other and then pulling apart, over and over again. Wearing this scent is like slowly adjusting your eyes to pitch darkness; with time, an incredible wealth of detail is revealed. The fragrance is deep, hot, and oily, but at the same time, it's as dry as a bone. The burnt sugar of tonka bean softens the searing heat of the pepper, like the edge of a cedar log caramelizing on an open fire. A remarkably crisp, airy fragrance emerges phoenix-like from the hot ashes. Fierce enough to command attention, sophisticated enough to leave a lasting impression, Blackpepper is the kind of sexy, modern, avant-garde masterpiece that could only have come from Comme des GarÃ§ons."," Black pepper, cedar, patchouli, agarwood (oud), tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21646.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gosha Rubchinskiy Eau de Toilette,1623,Comme des Garcons," Gosha Rubchinskiy: Photographer, artist, and chronicler of Russian youth street culture. Comme des Garcons: The avant-garde designer that brought her art to the masses. Their first joint fragrance project: As edgy as one might expect. And like Rubchinskiy's clothes, this scent will evoke strong reactions. Inspired by skateboarding on a summer's day in an anonymous Russian city, Gosha Rubchinskiy for Comme des Garcons smells excitingly of lost youth: hot tar mingling with the scent of rubber wheels and the mineral spark of board against concrete. The blackcurrant tang of buchu tea lends a samovar-like flavor to proceedings, briefly flushing the monochromatic palette with rosy tannins. The memory of hot sidewalks and remembered freedom lurks within the cool, flinty vetiver and the dry, dusty patchouli. To be worn with a statement t-shirt and attitude."," Angelica root, buchu, mandarin seed, blue chamomile, styrax, Haitian vetiver, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21647.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Concrete Eau de Parfum,1041,Comme des Garcons," The maestros of the unexpected have again tackled a quotidian material and managed to tease apart the surprises that lie within the banal. Comme des Garcons' Concrete is, straightforwardly enough, housed in a grey shell of poured concrete, but uniquely hand-formed. Freed from the streets beneath our feet, concrete becomes a material worthy of observation and appreciation. And the enclosed scent, too, reveals in its first puff what happens when stereotypes are shattered. The first moments of Concrete are shocking – from this weighty concrete pebble, one would expect a harsh industrial scent, but instead, a cloud of soft-focused sherbert, melting in the street, greets the senses. This is Comme des Garcons at its most subtle, honed in on the slightest of details. In the ambiently fruity, lactonic haze, there's a metallic zing, contributed by rose oxide. Lightly spicy, with cinnamon and cardamom, this is a strange, fizzing scent. And as it progresses, the creaminess grows drier. There's an“aha!” moment when the mind connects the dots, and it becomes discernable as the most velvety of woods – sandalwood. What Comme des Garcons describes as a“deconstructed” sandalwood, Concrete is a scent that is more than the sum of its parts – identifiable, but still beautifully quixotic in its alignment. The industrial made natural, and nature deconstructed.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77210.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Andy Warhol's You're In Eau de Toilette,2622,Comme des Garcons," You're In - Say that three times fast, and you can't help but let out an impish laugh. The title of a 1967 artwork by the godfather of Pop Art, Andy Warhol, You're In consisted of Coca-Cola bottles spray-painted his classic silver, and filled with a strange citrus cologne akin to urine (get the pun?) Now reimagined as a chic fragrance by Comme des Garcons, You're In stays true to its avant-garde roots, from the sleek silvery bottle to the zingy, metallic scent within. In a nod to Andy Warhol's multiples, You're In is released as a singular scent but in different unique collectible bottles, inscribed with varying famous quotes by the artist. But the true star here is the fragrance itself - the top notes open in a thirst-quenching burst of bitter orange and zesty makrout lime bubbling atop Comme des Garcons' signature soapy-herbaceous aldehydes. It's a shimmering, scrubbed-clean kind of sophisticated, and completed with pittosporum, a hyper-concentrated twin of orange blossom, and a softening hint of jasmine. Like a cold splash of water from a technicolor fountain, Andy Warhol's You're In leaves a mark as iconic as old Andy himself.Please note that Andy Warhol's You're In is a singular fragrance, available in different packaging options - each with a specific quote on the bottle and box:""Art is what you can get away with.""""I never fall apart, because I never fall together.""""I never read, I just look at pictures.""""If everybody is not a beauty, then nobody is.""""In the future everybody will be world famous for fifteen minutes."""," Bitter orange, aldehydes, makrut lime zest, jasmine, coriander leaf, pittosporum, cashmere wood, musk, metallic amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21648.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escentric 01 Eau de Toilette,1917,Escentric Molecules," Second only to its sister scent Molecule 01, Escentric 01 boasts the highest concentration of the aroma chemical Iso E Super ever to be used in perfumery (65%).  The woody nature of this note is joined with top notes of pink pepper, lime peel and orris incense to create a moving fragrance intent on taking you right from the opening to the base in one sweeping, dramatic move. The tart lime and zesty pink pepper are a sparkling shot into the dark heart of Escentric 01's moody, soft wood nature, while orris incense adds a dash of smoky incense and turns up the heat.

Odeur 53 Eau de Toilette,2474,Comme des Garcons," Mission: a scent that nobody recognized. Abstract. Lack of a been there, done that snooze-fest.In 1998, CdG stepped away from natural ingredients, seeking to clone the ultra-modern straight outta the manmade world. The result? Fifty three non-traditional notes comprise this masterpiece, resulting in a very recognizable scent of crisp air mixing with cotton-drying-in-the-wind. We think it smells like a brand-new car and warm, soft human skin-perfection. You may think it sounds strange until you realize just how many of the notes of Odeur 53 you know (and love). 'Cept for the nail polish part. We don't smell that at all."," oxygen, flash of metal, fire energy, washing drying in the wind, mineral carbon, sand dunes, nail polish, cellulose, pure air of the high mountains, ultimate fusion, burnt rubber, flaming rock",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Odeur 71 Eau de Toilette,2611,Comme des Garcons," The ultimate anti-perfume. The notes are inspired by dust on a hot lightbulb, bamboo, metal, electricity and lettuce juice...no lie! But what does it smell like? Surprisingly, it's a completely wearable scent; metal and electricity manifest as the invigorating smell of ozone just before a storm, and the combination of we-don't-know-what makes for a familiar soapy freshness. Hot laundry right out of the dryer served up on your clean, sexy Xerox machine. Released in 2000, Odeur 71 continues to make huge stir-not just for its revolutionary scent structure, but because it's a testament that a combination of the truly weird can make a truly fantastic fragrance."," incense, wood, moss, willow, elm, bay leaves, bamboo, hyacinth",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Based on the legendary Sumi ink made in the temples of Japan, this seductive fragrance blends the seared wood notes of Sumi with spiritual scents of incense, patchouli and amber, then takes a turn toward the shiny n' happy with the bright notes of magnolia and ripe, fresh new aldehydes (orange and mandarin). We smell something different every time we wear this-it falls somewhere between a mighty Samurai and a humble priest with a jones for gardening.

Anchored throughout by a soft cedarwood, White incorporates may rose and lily of the valley to lend softness, and adds the unusual topnote of pomegranate-which comes through as a peep of tart freshness in the beginning. Amber and vanilla add warmth and sensuality. If you're familiar with scents like 10 Corso Como, you'll recognize White as the forerunner to striking, woody florals with a kick."," spices, lily of the valley, may rose, pomegranate, vanilla, cedarwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
2 MAN Eau de Toilette,2481,Comme des Garcons," The fragrance that's causing crazed mobs to empty the shelves in Europe and Japan is here!  CdG 2 MAN is a revision of the original 2 (in the silver bottle), taking it in a more woody/incense direction and creating a whole new animal.  Smoldering at first, 2 MAN roars out of the gate, declaring its boldness and contempt for simpering little focus-group scents that are a mishmash of ""manly"" notes.  2 MAN's simmering and incensey opening unfolds into an unusual combination of nutmeg, vetiver and subtle saffron flowers, each one appearing like chapters in a book.  As the pages turn and it evolves on the skin, a subdued mahogany and leather bring up the rear. Daring but not brash or loud; complex yet never persnickety.  It's a sure-bet for a modern classic."," incense, white smoke, saffron flowers, nutmeg, vetiver roots, mahogany,  leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21620.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Original Eau de Parfum,1753,Comme des Garcons," CdG's legendary eau de parfum was originally released in 1994 and considered by most CdG fans to be their finest. Eau de parfum is hailed as a fragrance that ""works like a medicine, behaves like a drug"". A sparkling array of spices awaken the senses, with notes of cinnamon, rose and clove. Like a balm, the scent invades the body--woody and resin work in concert with harmonies of honey and cedarwood. Full of softness and warmth...the complexity subsides."," labdanum, cedarwood, cardamom, cinnamon, rose, black pepper, honey, clove, nutmeg, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21619.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
3 Eau de Toilette,1644,Comme des Garcons," What would a flower that didn't exist smell like? CdG3 was borne from a dream by its creator, in which an electric, incandescent flower shines out of a primordial, lava-filled nothingness. Completely living up to that Sci-Fi inspired dream, CdG3 is a fragrantly opalescent rendering of what it would be like to find a never before seen or imagined flower growing on another planet.  By turns bold and elusive, energetic and bewitching, the top and middle notes of black rose oxide, mace, angelica and basil spring up from the earthier base notes of cedar, birch and sandalwood, drying down to a fresh, mysterious, powdery greenness.  A seamless blend of modern and organic, seething and subtle, CdG3 captures all that we love about these kind of dreams: pure, tangible possibility."," Basil, mandarin, black currant, magnolia, everlasting flower, angelica, Lebanese cedar, birch essence, sandalwood.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21618.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Wonderwood Eau de Parfum,1086,Comme des Garcons," After several collaborative projects, Comme des GarÃ§ons launches a purely Comme des GarÃ§ons scent –“A positive overdose of woods, woody notes and synthetic wood constructions (Wood gone mad).” And it has.Wood, of course, has been part of the Comme des GarÃ§ons Parfums DNA from the outset, and here perfumer Antoine Lie has pulled out all the stops: this is all wood, just like it says on the bottle, the notes melding through the common smokiness of incense, guaiac, sandalwood, vetiver and oud with a hint of musty patchouli, dried out by cypress and cedar, wrapped in the powdery, velvety muskiness of Cashmeran. This sensuous ode to woodiness, translated into an eerie gorgeous visual rhapsody by the Quay Brothers, may just be the most quintessentially CdG fragrance since its first, groundbreaking offering by Mark Buxton in 1994, Comme des GarÃ§ons Eau de Parfum. It is wood made liquid and smoke and take our word, like the man“who loved woods more than any words could say” in the video, you'll want to drown in it. Wonder indeed."," Madagascan pepper, bergamot, Somalian incense, nutmeg, Cristalon, Cashmeran, guaiac wood, cedarwood, caraway seeds, Javanol, sandalwood, vetiver, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21622.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amazingreen Eau de Parfum,1102,Comme des Garcons," In an interview to a French magazine, the perfumer Jean-Christophe HÃ©rault admitted to a twin obsession with the sap-filled scent of lentiscus and the smell of freshly renovated old houses. Somehow this blend of green and mineral must have inspired Amazingreen. Or did he take his cue from the flint and smoke facets of vetiver?This“blast of green energy” from Comme des GarÃ§ons starts out cool as a tropical shower from bouncing shiny leaves the size of umbrellas. Moves on to a slightly sulfurous“gunpowder accord” (think of how the air smells after fireworks) as guerillas skulk through the undergrowth. Is that something burning? The ice-cold sear of green pepper on the tongue, the wisps of smoke of a campfire in a secret clearing...Tough and lush, exuberant but slightly dangerous, the vegetal and mineral elements unfurl their various facets side by side. Trouble's clearly brewing in the jungle."," Palm tree leaves, green pepper, dew mist, jungle leaves, Ivy leaves, orris roots, coriander seeds, silex, Gunpowder accord, vetiver, smoke, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21628.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Black Eau de Toilette,2077,Comme des Garcons," Black is many things. One of those things is a positive number on a balance sheet, the opposite of red. That may be the thinking behind BLACK, Comme des GarÃ§ons' fragrance started in 2009“In response to the general negativity engendered by the recession and to counter the feeling of things being blocked or stopped because of the crisis.”œFour years later, the brand marks the concepts anniversary through the launch of BLACK Eau de Toilette, an emergency, guerrilla-like, spiced-up new scent, which Rei Kawakubo, never one to shy away from literalism, has infused with Madagascar black pepper and Somalian incense, with essences of leather, licorice, birch tar and pepperwood. The result? A swoon-inducing trip into the smokey, spiritual world of incense, touched by the solar warmth of pepper and cedar wood. The licorice note adds a touch of cleansing 'eternalness' and, at times, feels uplifting. And in the end, we're left in a dizzying spell of delight. Dark and mysterious, yet ultimately calm and reassuring."," Cedarwood, vetiver, leather, liquorice, birch tar, pepperwood, black pepper, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21631.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Wonderoud Eau de Parfum,1670,Comme des Garcons," WONDEROUD is the ultimate incarnation of wood expressed through the most exquisite wood notes-- OUD. One of nature's most precious gifts, Oud is worth its weight in gold. An aromatic resin, scented with subtle notes, Oud is known as The Black Gold of Perfumers. Used only for the most precious and mythical concoctions, its powerful and rich character brings a woody, animal, balsamic and even honey feel and texture to a fragrance.100% Natural Oud extracted from resinous Aquilaria trees grown sustainably in South East Asia.

Serpentine Eau de Toilette,1781,Comme des Garcons,"“The Grass, The Trees, The Lake, And You”... The British artist Tracey Emin scrawled the words on the bottle. She also draw a couple embracing for the box, based on a sculpture she bought in Paris for her 50th birthday.The scent was designed by Christian Astuguevieille with Ã‰milie Coppermann on the occasion of the Serpentine Galleries' expanded presence in the Royal Park of Kensington Gardens with the new Serpentine Sackler Gallery, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects. And of course, this being Comme des GarÃ§ons, it conjures not only the bucolic fragrances of Hyde Park (that's the“grass, trees and lake” part) but a hefty whiff of London. What other brand would be loony enough to claim asphalt and“a little bit of pollution” in its notes list? As unabashedly avant-garde as the venue it was created for, Serpentine's depiction of“Nature in the City” joins the groundbreaking Odeurs (53 and 71) and the cult Synthetics series in celebrating the evocative powers and bracing beauty of urban smells. You'll be wearing a piece of contemporary art."," Grass, leaves, pollen (galbanum, iris leaf), oxygen (aldehyde, ozone), asphalt (black musk, nutmeg), labdanum, smoked cedar with a little bit of pollution (benzoin, juniper wood, guaiac wood)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21638.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Floriental Eau de Parfum,1784,Comme des Garcons," Even if you were unfamiliar with the term, you'd know a 'floriental' when you smelled it- this fragrance family combining floral notes with the dark woods, spices and resins that distinguish orientals are so popular as to be nearly ubiquitous. But with Comme des GarÃ§ons, there's always a twist, and so Floriental, the newest fragrance from the avant garde Japanese/French fashion stalwart, has chosen as its floral of note the Cistus flower- a flower without a scent. And so, CDG's Floriental is a postmodern floral, one where the sweet, lush, peppery aspects of flowers are created from plum, pink pepper, and sandalwood, and where labdanum- the rich resin that's the true fragrant bounty of the cistus bush- forms the basis of the oriental notes for a floral oriental both innovative and yet true in spirit. And in the modern, mischievous style of Comme des GarÃ§ons, Floriental is even nontraditional in structure- without classically defined top, heart and base notes, the fragrance evolves in unpredictable waves, trading off between lush fruitiness, resinous woods and fiery spice with delightful frequency, resulting in a scent that wears differently each time. At once layered and unstructured, simple and modern, masculine and feminine, Floriental is a landscape of wonderful contradiction, with a single exception- it's 100% CDG."," Pink pepper, plum, incense, labdanum, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21643.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dot Eau de Parfum,1846,Comme des Garcons," The deceptive simplicity and industrial whimsy that define the Comme des GarÃ§ons aesthetic has always proven to be a remarkably versatile template for all types of fragrances. Dot, the newest release from the venerable house, demonstrates this with great aplomb: a fresh, fruity floral with wonderfully unique touches of resin and green notes, Dot is both lusciously feminine, but also distinctly CDG. Inspired not only by the smell of the Osmanthus flower but equally by the mysterious allure of a park filled with Osmanthus trees in bloom, Dot is more tone-poem than standard soliflore. The scent radiates with floral smoothness, but also with the fruity tonalities that emanates from the blossoms, the radiant green notes that illustrate the leaves, and white ambery woods that reflect the bark of the tree. Resinous olibanum gives the distinct character of a park set within a bustling cityscape, and pepper oil further enhances the balsamic, spicy aspect of the incense. The result is just as pretty as one could hope for, but with the distinctive character of another wonderfully modern Comme des GarÃ§ons creation. Like the titular white dots on the eye-catching flacon, Dot is sure to make you stand out from the crowd."," Osmanthus, fruits, green notes, amberwood, olibanum, pepper, bitter orange",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21644.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Grace by Grace Coddington Eau de Toilette,2781,Comme des Garcons,"“I've always loved the smell of roses and the first fragrance I ever wore was rose water. Over time, I've experimented with everyone else's version of Rose, and even got sidetracked by some others along the way. Now I've arrived back at the point I first started, with Rose. Except this time, it's my Rose.” – Grace CoddingtonAnd what a rose Grace has brought us. Fiesty and flirty, but with a dash of elegance, Grace by Grace Coddington opens with a wondrously fresh, delicately edgy opening of citrus and aromatics, all the while anchored by a youthful but deep rose supported with fruity depth. Vetiver and smooth, musky woods lend character and strength, but this is rose's party, and the lush, fresh, sexy florals are front-and-center to the very last compelling sniff. An icon like Grace deserves no less.Housed in a wonderfully feline-inspired bottle to celebrate Grace's lifelong love of cats."," Bergamot, mint, basil, cardamom, pink peppercorn, rose, freesia, peach blossom, vetiver, cashmere woods, white musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21645.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Muskane Demi Extrait,2876,Nishane," Between light and dark, innocent and wicked, and EDP and extrait, lies Nishane's new Icons Collection- striking, seductive new scents presented in a ""demi extrait"" concentration and based around a central component. Muskane, as the name might suggest, is a musk lovers paradise- an indulgently powdery, smoothly floral, gently gourmand cloud of muskiness that confidently struts the line between divine purity and carnal sin. Gently sweet, piquant raspberry infuses a low hum of energy into the delicate yet lush rose and powdered violet of the floral body, which in turn amplifies the overwhelming and delightful cascade of soft, sexy, lightly creamy musk, topped with a dollop of ambered vanilla.Smooth and seductive, pillowy and powdery, Muskane is enough to make you weak in the knees."," Raspberry, rose, violet, amber, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774054.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Florane Demi Extrait,2267,Nishane," Between light and dark, innocent and wicked, and EDP and extrait, lies Nishane's new Icons Collection- striking, seductive new scents presented in a ""demi extrait"" concentration and based around a central component. Florane is, you guessed it, a floral scent, with a powerful and complex heart of violet, muguet (lily of the valley), and jasmine, but if you're picturing a demure, powdered white floral, think again- kissed with bright, juicy fruit and sweetened with warm, ambered woods, Florane is a vivid, vibrant, unforgettably sexy floral rich with delightfully unexpected combinations. An opening of beautifully tart grapefruit and aromatic cassis set the stage for the aforementioned floral heart, which feels neither overly vintage nor simplistically youthful- rather, it's a sexy, modern, three-dimensional bouquet that grows more dynamic still with the warm, woodsy base of amber, hinoki, musk, and the perfect touch of sweet vanilla. The result is a striking, long-lasting, and complex floral that can transition from sweatpants to soirees and back again without breaking stride. In other words, just the kind of versatile, creative, and compelling stunner we've come to expect from every new Nishane release."," Grapefruit, cassis, violet, muguet, jasmine, amber, hinoki, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774055.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lustre Eau de Parfum,1089,Hiram Green Perfumes," Imagine the sun rising over seemingly endless fields of roses in the heartland of Bulgaria. Lovers of rose know that given the infinite complexity inherent to the flower, a true rose soliflore may be anything except predictably simple. It is in this wondrous spirit that Hiram Green delivers Lustre, a celebration of the exquisite Bulgarian rose that combines everything we love about rose with everything we love about Hiram Green. To put it another way, Lustre is a vivacious, joyful, sun-drenched rose scent with an abundance of both naturalism and sophistication. This is unmistakably Bulgarian rose, so lush and fresh that you can feel the soft flesh of pink petals between your fingers, with citrus to maximize its sparkling brightness, creamy orris to round out the lush floral profile, and just a dab of olibanum for richness and longevity and to complement the rose's natural honeyed sweetness. A near perfect Bulgarian rose soliflore, Lustre is a new triumph for one of niche perfume's most meteoric rising stars."," Bulgarian rose, citrus, orris, olibanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Eau de Reims,2850,Reims Parfums," L'Eau de Reims smells very French. Primarily an essay on the fresh, celery-like greenness of petitgrain and neroli, Duchaufour twists things in a slightly chyprÃ© direction with a generous lick of salty, dark green oakmoss. Even more delightfully, proceedings open here with a volley of bitter, lemony eau de cologne-style notes that last just long enough to jolt its wearer awake. The real star of L'Eau de Reims, however, is that remarkable petitgrain-neroli accord. Although neroli is not listed, we're sure we smell its modulating influence here, softening the lemony sharpness of the petitgrain with its characteristic soapy freshness and its lingering vegetal notes. A hint of geranium emphasizes the spicy, leafy greenness of the neroli. Oakmoss provides structure to the drydown, supporting the freshness of the petitgrain-neroli heart with a robust, salty minerality that never strays into dankness. We think L'Eau de Reims is a real tour de force for summer wear – as fresh and clean as a traditional eau de cologne, yet with the salty heft of a properly French chypre base. A new classic in the making? We think so."," Petitgrain, neroli, incense, geranium, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Haute Provence Eau de Cologne,2102,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," While wild lavender abounds throughout the countryside of Provence,  master perfumers know that ""true lavender, "" that which only grows at an altitude above 1200 meters,  has no substitute- boasting both fresher,  more camphorous tones and a sweeter,  richer,  warmer tone as it dries,  it's a superior material in every way to its common counterpart. So it's no surprise that Mme. Patricia de Nicolai,  perhaps the greatest living inheritor of the grand legacy of vintage French perfumery,  accepts nothing less than Haute Provence lavender in her fragrances,  and believes in its value as an ingredient so much that she presents it here,  with minimal embellishment,  as an eau de cologne- and the results are impressive. If anything,  the openness of an EDC lets the star ingredient shine,  delivering intensely sharp,  bright freshness up top,  complemented with spicy,  citric petitgrain,  and then drying to a smooth,  creamy iris-paired musky woodsiness that lingers with just the right amount of unassuming confidence on the skin. A classic eau de cologne is a vivid,  fresh sensory experience meant to strip away the levels of artifice between fragrance and nature. By those standards,  Haute Provence is an unmistakable gem."," Petitgrain, bergamot, lavender, iris, musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31359.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hossegor Eau de Parfum,2134,A Lab on Fire," ""You walk through woods wet with spray and alive. Your fingertips, the tendrils of a fern, reach into the deep foliage, dissolve into the infinite. Why do you travel to where the sun shakes your hand? What good is devotion if it cannot combine body, land, sea, sky into equal parts loneliness and love? Lie down and rest here. And be made whole.""This is the pitch behind Hossegor, one of the most original and compelling oceanic scents we've experienced in quite some time. Inspired by the resort town deep in the south of France, an unforgettable pairing of beachside surfer's paradise and a lush marine lake, Hossegor the scent delivers a bracing, invigorating, and ultimately deeply soothing combination of mineral, herbaceous, woodsy, and aromatic notes that tap into a near-primal sense of sublimity. From a compellingly spicy, green, and herbaceous opening of fiery black pepper and resinous mastic to a rich aromatic heart of sage and oceanic sea salt, every note feels powerful yet balanced, naturalistic yet stylish, and glowing with the tempered warmth of the glowing sun setting over the rapidly cooling, tree-lined lakeside. A Lab On Fire has chased the sun everywhere from Ipanema to the South Pacific, but with Hossegor, they may have found their best destination yet."," Juniper, mastic, black pepper, sea salt, clary sage, orris root, olibanum, solar accord, ambergris, vetiver, mineral musks, wet woods, ambrox, sea moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56718.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ani Extrait de Parfum,2088,Nishane," An ancient metropolis now abandoned to the ages, Ani and its many ruined churches now stand as a monument to the both the majesty of empire and the inevitability of time. To honor this mystical place and capture its unique evolution, Nishane has created a fragrance that juxtaposes bright freshness, fiery spice, rugged woods, and rich warmth- a true voyage through the ages. Ani opens with a bright, bracingly fresh and green bergamot- overflowing with juicy citrus and the snap of fresh vegetation, evoking the overgrowth that has retaken the crumbled walls. A blazing wash of gingery spice suggests the life that still remains, while a gorgeous, fruity rose peeks from between ancient stone. We feel the power of history, now, as rich, creamy, resinous vanilla and rich, earthy wood echo with multitude of voices now left to history. Complex, robust, and vibrant, Ani is a fragrance with true heritage to its name."," Bergamot, green notes, blue ginger, pink pepper, blackcurrant, Turkish rose, cardamom, patchouli, cedarwood, vanilla, benzoin, ambergris, musk, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Unutamam Extrait de Parfum,2538,Nishane," As the first entry in Nishane's bold new ""Experimental Collection, "" Unutamam was bound to defy easy categorization. But that turns out to be the point: as conceived by Nishane and star fragrance blogger and creator Miguel Matos,  Unutamam (the name of a famous Turkish song) intentionally straddles the line between lush seduction and animalic ferocity,  leaving it to the wearer to decide which mood to allow the scent to embody. Unutamam,  from first spray,  is an intense experience: a whip's lash of lacerating aromatics and florals,  defying any attempt at a complacent reaction. Even as the florals grow smoother and lusher,  a smoky,  industrial undertone grows,  with patchouli,  labdanum,  and castoreum approximating the animalic thrum of petroleum,  the rough protection of military-grade leather. Or perhaps your journey into this intriguing and dynamic fragrance takes you in the other direction,  to a garden of herbaceous delight and sweet,  smooth caramelized amber. After all,  the choice is entirely yours- and what an accomplishment that is."," lavender, rosemary, mint, juniper, jasmine, carnation, patchouli, amber, oregano, castoreum, cistus, oakmoss, caramel",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Milano Cento For Him Eau de Toilette,2583,Milano Cento," A bona fide 1980's cult classic, Milano Cento was born in an era of cultural futurism and modernist design, but with an eye towards the classics. Now, nearly 40 years later, it's never been more compelling. Inspired by the wonderfully diverse, aromatic plants of Italy, Milano Cento Him opens with zesty, sparkling notes of lemon, bergamot and green petitgrain. Herbaceous notes of lavender and rosemary combine with the intensity of basil and clary sage, followed by rich, sensual sandalwood and patchouli. Spicy clove, cinnamon, amber and warm musks live in the memory and in the heart. Sophisticated and stylish, this blend of vintage flair and modern energy is designed to keep the past alive while stepping boldly into the future."," Lemon, bergamot, petitgrain, lavender, rosemary, basil, clary sage, sandalwood, patchouli, clove, cinnamon, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/823000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Douce Amere Eau de Parfum,2045,Serge Lutens," Devilishly bitter, then divinely sweet – this eccentric brew is a bundle of contradictions from the moment it touches your skin. The absinthe is cool and the cinnamon is hot. The flowers are ethereal and the wood is strong. The licorice is sharp and the powder is soft and it all melds together in an indescribable way that will having you sneaking off to sniff your arm again and again. Moody and contrary, this is the unexpected lightness of heart at the sight of a gray, rainy day; the decadent thrill of reveling in a bad mood overlong; the sharp stab of melancholy when you hear of someone else being happy. This is dark and troubled and enigmatic, even through the sweetest parts, and at the heart of it all is the aromatic Artemisia absinthum, almost medicinal at first but becoming a warm and glowing narcotic presence as the elixir develops. Edgy and fiendishly attractive, this is the perfect scent to wear when you are looking for trouble. Actually, if you wear it, trouble will probably find you first."," Absinthe (Artemisia absinthum) , cinnamon, anise, lily, jasmine, tiare, tagette, marigold, musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36118.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rahat Loukhoum Eau de Parfum,1654,Serge Lutens," Not truly loukhoum, with its rosy gelatin texture, but rather freshly baked pasticche di mandrel, those bone-white, chewy little almond cookies sold everywhere in Rome. If you've ever tried them, then you'll know that they are not as tooth-achingly sweet as they appear, the bitterness of cherry pit cutting through the thick dusting of confectioner's sugar. It's that balance of bitter and sweet that makes you dip greedily into the bag again and again.And so it is with Rahat Loukoum. The sweet honey, almonds, and creamy vanilla are glossed with just enough bitter cherries, hawthorn, and balsams to stop you from putting your wrist in your mouth. The base, surprisingly resinous, exerts firm control over the sweet, fluffy heliotrope, and walks the fragrance straight down the line of edible-inedible. Rahat Loukoum is that rare scent is that is far from your average gourmand-- though with Serge Lutens' pedigree, we're guessing you already knew that. Please note that Palais Royal Collection bell jars are splash bottles"," Aldehydes, almond, cherry, hawthorn, rose, heliotrope, white honey, vanilla, tonka bean, balsam, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36157.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Iris Silver Mist Eau de Parfum,1256,Serge Lutens," More iris, more, more, more, Serge Lutens famously urged Maurice Roucel when he was composing Iris Silver Mist. Legend has it that poor Maurice went back to the lab and, in his desperation, threw every known iris material into the formula, including a little-used iris nitrile called Irival. What emerged chrysalis-like from this chaotic lab experiment was a wonder of nature and a work of art.Iris Silver Mist smells entirely like a root freshly torn from the ground, caked with earth, dew, and ice. Its purity is lung-filling and green - as bracing as cold water running in a brook. Between the iced, milky roots of the topnotes and the cool musk in the base, clove and benzoin lend the texture a spicy, dusty feel that almost approaches human warmth. But make no mistake – Iris Silver Mist is as brutally pure as a block of ice melting slowly in a forest on the Russian Steppes. As close to wearing a piece of art as you're likely to get. Please note that Palais Royal Collection bell jars are splash bottles"," Orris root, galbanum, sandalwood, cedar, clove, vetiver, musk, benzoin, incense, white amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36158.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bois Et Musc Eau de Parfum,1176,Serge Lutens," Ahh, Bois et Musc! We have a particular fondness for this unfairly overlooked gem in the Lutens Bois series, which wears like a sunset in smudgy golds and pinks. Bois et Musc is a soft, rosy cedarwood diffused out into a cloud of musk and sweetened with a judicious touch of spice (the notes say saffron, but we also smell a gentle nutmeg, cinnamon, and perhaps even a smattering of cumin). Far woodier and less syrupy-fruity than its siblings in the Bois series – Bois de Violette and Bois et Fruits – Bois et Muscs may actually be closer in spirit to the original Shiseido FeminitÃ© du Bois than the current Serge Lutens version.           More than scent, however, Bois et Musc is all about texture: its musk is velvety and beeswaxy, while its cedarwood is silky. Not as dirty as Muscs Khoublai Khan but not nearly as clean as Clair de Musc, Bois et Musc is, for us, the happy medium of Lutensian musks. It is sensual as hell but in that comfortably discreet way that makes people wonder if you're wearing perfume or just smell particularly good. And when you're wearing Bois et Musc, you most certainly do. Please note that Palais Royal Collection bell jars are splash bottles"," Atlas cedarwood, beeswax, saffron, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36167.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sarrasins Eau de Parfum,1495,Serge Lutens," Rich yet airy and ”˜clear', Sarrasins is the sheer silk shawl to La Nuit's dense buttercream satin. Famously alluring, this scent derives its charm from the juxtaposition of innocence and sensuality. Though the opening is a burst of crystalline jasmine sharpened with a needlepoint of camphor and other mysterious greenery (privet hedge? mint?), its freshness is immediately counterpoised by a smudge of inky indole. Sarrasins is very elegant and very French - a rudely botanical hothouse flower styled and teased up into a chignon. In the heart, hints of hay and tea give the jasmine a transparency it does not possess in real life. The dry clove-like spiciness of carnation is framed against the crispness of green apples and grapes taken straight from the chiller. Beneath this impression of freshness, however, a sultry osmanthus and castoreum slyly join forces to create a dark, dry apricot leather that smells like skin at the nape of the neck. Sarrasins' je ne sais quoi emanates from this contrast between a living flower tumbling off a vine and the soft, skin-like suede notes that give it an abstract sophistication.

Vanilla Vibes Eau de Parfum,1009,Juliette Has a Gun," Everyone loves a vanilla scent. Playful, romantic, mouthwatering, sensual- it's the smell both of first crushes and decadent delicacies. And now, thanks to a clever and creative new release from Juliette Has A Gun, it's the scent of sun-kissed skin and fresh, sexy, summertime bliss.Inspired by the joy and spectacle of a summer music festival, Vanilla Vibes is a bold yet blissful combination of sensual vanilla and invigorating sea salt. From the first spritz, we swear we can feel the energy and excitement, as the bracing oceanic rush of salty atmosphere intertwines with a sweet and creamy, yet youthful vanilla, along with a warm, sensuous sandalwood.  A hymn to adventure and freedom, Vanilla Vibes is more than just your new summer go-to: it's guaranteed to keep the good times rolling all year round."," Fleur de sel, vanilla absolute, orchid, sandalwood, tonka bean, brown musk, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40133.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Winter Palace Eau de Parfum,2944,MEMO," A stunning fantasia of fiery resins and smooth tea, Winter Palace is a mythological vision of China where dragons soar and intrigue lurks behind every gate. We're swept away from the opening burst of rich, oily, tea-infused citrus- miles from both the salty freshness of a Mediterranean citrus scent or the sunny sweetness of a California one- balanced against robust, gently toasty matÃ©. The exotic richness only deepens from here, as the distinctive red tea heart, earthy and subtly tart, takes on richer, more resinous character with a cascade of balsamic woods, as awe-inspiring and powerful as the serpentine form of a Chinese dragon undulating along the hill-studded landscape like a Great Wall in motion. As a deep, warm, vanilla-rich amber emerges in the base, we feel the true power of the scent, compelling and unique, imbued with ancient sophistication but glowing with vibrant potency. If you yearn for the ultimate combination of bright and rich, power and refinement- discover Winter Palace today."," Grapefruit, bergamot, lemon, mate, gurjum balsam, amber wood, tolu, benzoin, labdanum, red tea, tonka, styrax, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69125.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
White Peaches Eau de Parfum,2953,Shay & Blue," As delightfully refreshing as a sparkling bellini or a scoop of sorbet on a scorching summer's day, White Peaches is an enchantingly simple burst of joy. Constructed around the unique nature of white peaches, which are sweeter, more floral and less tart than their more common yellow counterparts, White Peaches serves up a delectably ripe peach note, juicy and cool on its own, but made positively thirst-quenching with the addition of an ""iced"" elderflower note, distinctively chilly and wonderfully fresh. A base of silver birch transposes its normally Christmas-y wintergreen aroma to this warm-weather cocktail, revealing another layer of revitalizing crispness. For anyone craving a luscious, authentic, non-syrupy peach note perfect for even the hottest of weather, White Peaches is a delicious delight."," White peach, narcissus, elderflower granita, silver birch",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70420.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sundazed Eau de Parfum,1515,BYREDO," Say hello to endless summer. Sundazed,  the newest scent from Byredo,  is an infectiously joyful blend of bright citrus,  sugared florals,  and a sparkling skin musk that fans of Blanche already know and love. It's a love letter to spontaneous daytrips and wholesome indulgences- the citrus is zesty,  mouthwatering,  and energetic,  the neroli heart rich,  romantic,  and made deliciously sweet with a sugared note of fresh-spun cotton candy. And it all dries down to a clean,  soft musk that glows for hours with the gentle warmth of sun-kissed skin after a long day of outdoor adventures. And when we say ""endless summer, "" that's exactly what we mean- since Sundazed is now part of Byredo's permanent collection,  you can experience this little slice of beachside bliss whenever you want. So whenever you need to change your mood- or keep the good times rolling- this is the one to reach for."," Mandarin, lemon, neroli, jasmine sambac, cotton candy, skin musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641203.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau de Minthe Eau de Parfum,1311,Diptyque," Invented in 1882 with the release of Houbigant's Fougere Royale, the distinctively fresh, classically masculine fougere is a stalwart of fine European fragrance- and until now, there's never been an entry from the equally iconic house of Diptyque. But in case you haven't figured it out from the name, Eau de Minthe is not your (great-great-?) grandfather's fougere; rather, it's an impressively clever twist on a classic that replaces the standard lavender-geranium-oakmoss DNA of a fougere with an electric jolt of mouthwatering mint in place of the lavender. Not only does this provide a striking unisex balance to a typically masculine genre, but it builds on a molecular connection between mint and geranium that lends the floral heart of the scent a dynamic aromatic resonance. As a soft patchouli base with a touch of mossy rose lends gentle strength, Eau de Minthe takes the form of a recognizable fougere- but never so much that its delightful individuality is lost. Vibrant, fresh, and utterly unique, Eau de Minthe is a new classic fougere to stand alongside the greats."," Mint, geranium, patchouli, rose oxide",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Splendiris Eau de Parfum,1917,Dusita," With the tremendous visual and olfactory beauty of the iris comes a unique challenge- how does one create an iris scent that improves upon what nature has already perfected? In the case of the truly magical newest release from Dusita, the answer lies in the subtleties- Splendiris showcases an utterly breathtaking orris absolute in all of its cool, purple, rich, and powdered glory, with just the right amount of fresh, dark, and gourmand supplemental notes to modernize, brighten, and smooth the whole experience into the realm of the sublime.Splendiris opens with a burst of juicy citrus and lively, gently aromatic green notes that feel fresh and contemporary, wiping clean your preconceptions about what an iris scent can be. As the richly floral heart emerges, we swoon over the elegance and richness of the orris butter, but further exploration reveals Splendiris to be much more than a single expensive ingredient- here, the natural rooty, powdery sophistication of iris is sweetened with violet and fig and given luscious texture with rose and jasmine to create a true bouquet. A perfect dollop of luxuriously creamy vanilla alongside woodsy vetiver and cedar enriches further, creating a rare fragrant plateau where sensuality, style, and naturalism share top billing. In other words, Splendiris is objectively an iris soliflore- but if all you smell is the iris, you're not paying attention to the dozens of brilliant combinations that make for the most gorgeously idealized iris you've ever experienced. While we've grown to expect world-class scents with each new Dusita release, Splendiris is, even by those standards, in a class of its own."," Bergamot, mandarin, orange, violet leaf, fig leaf, carrot seed, sweet orris butter, iris, violet, rose de mai, jasmine sambac, vanilla, vetiver, cedar, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose Of No Man's Land Hair Perfume,1572,BYREDO," BYREDO presents a hair perfume collection that invites you to care for and delicately scent the hair in one sensuous beautifying gesture. Enjoy the uplifting power of long lasting scents as they subtly diffuse throughout the day, amplified by the natural movement of the hair. Each hair perfume combines one of BYREDO's signature scents with a unique silicone and polymer formula to create a light, invisible veil designed to leave the hair nourished and luminous whilst divinely scented. Rose of No Man's Land is centered around the delicate petals of a Turkish rose, both strikingly lush and softly sweet. A radiant chord of raspberry gives the heart notes fruit-laden depth, while a papyrus wood base and white amber chord add an eternal and sophisticated aura, delivering, in total, a rosebud of immense purity."," Pink pepper, Turkish rose petals, raspberry blossom, Turkish rose absolute, papyrus, white amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641202.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Malt Eau de Parfum,2172,Akro," What happens when you cross a peaty Laphroaig whiskey with an aquatic? Malt. Sure, it's the answer to a question we don't remember asking, but we're so happy that such a thing actually exists. Opening with a gorgeously caramelized whiskey note that conjures up both the smokiness and the toffee-like depth of an aged whiskey from the highlands of Scotland, Malt quickly slips into a firmly mid-tone register: rich but light, with toasty brown woods unobtrusively holding it together. This deft lightness of touch is underscored by a minty, anisic tobacco-like note, which the notes say is seaweed. Certainly, this note gains in salt and crunch as time wears on, but while it is redolent of the sea, it less the sweet, melony undertone of Calone-driven aquatics, and more the naturally green, salty outdoorsy air blowing in off the North Sea. Wearing Malt feels like drinking a glass of peaty Scotch with friends at a beach bonfire on a cold October evening, the air infused with salt, heather, and good, old-fashioned bonhomie."," Whiskey, Rum, Leather, Seaweed, Patchouli.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dark Eau de Parfum,2642,Akro," Oh man, this is good. A thick pour of molten dark chocolate to begin with, as strong and as intense as an espresso, but absent any of the metallic or animalic aspects that can sometimes emerge in dark chocolate. This is dark chocolate idealized. It's not sweet or creamy, but there's a strong hint of caramelized milk running underneath the rafters of the scent to pull it back from acridity. It's pure unadulterated dark chocolate bliss.Throughout the day, as the dark chocolate tonality ebbs away, a gloriously rich, nutty base steps forward to fill the vacuum. Spicy, cinnamon-flecked tonka and hazelnut notes combine with vanilla to create a suede-textured drydown that seems to go on forever without shedding any of its richness – a thing of beauty in a world where oftentimes the ending is rushed. Interestingly, though from the same hand that created Angel, Dark is its complete opposite – plush but not fruity, and gourmand but not edible or ”˜yummy'. Dark is an exquisitely balanced, elegant chocolate quasi-gourmand that leans to the adult side of the indulgence spectrum. An utter pleasure to wear."," Cocoa, Dark Chocolate, Cinnamon, Hazelnut, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Night Eau de Parfum,2649,Akro," Night will make you blush. A finger stroke's worth of cumin imbues an innocently rosy musk with enough inner thigh naughtiness to stop anyone in their track's, retrace their steps, and follow that divine scent to its source: you. Night is sexy because it dances on that barely perceptible line between clean and dirty, never tipping its hand too far in one direction or the other, and therefore keeping you guessing all the way through.Picture the aftermath of love – sheets tangled, traces of clean sweat and passionate kisses cooling quickly on the pillow. Your lover's gone, but everything still smells of them, including your skin and hair. Mingling with the scent of love is the fresh smell of the neroli and rose soap you both washed with that morning, and the starchy brightness of just-laundered sheets. The prismatic dance between clean and dirty, fresh and lived-in in Night is utterly entrancing; it feels sexy and alive and human."," Bulgarian Rose, Cumin, Saffron, Agaroud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Smoke Eau de Parfum,1418,Akro," Smoking. The ultimate modern taboo. A dirty word. And yet, for those old enough to remember, there is something viscerally pleasing about the acrid aroma of a freshly-lit cigarette – perhaps because all the more attractive for its illicit, banned-in-public places, worse-than-marijuana notoriety it now enjoys. How AKRO Smoke smells to you will depend on your experience with smoking. For reformed smokers, it will smell nostalgic and haunting, a memory of coats, hair, and rooms impregnated with the acrid scent of cigarettes long stubbed out. For the uninitiated, it may smell almost shockingly intense, boasting a range of aromas from rubber and camphor to ash. A smidgen of sweetness from creamy tonka and powdery benzoin in the base is there for support, but in the end, there is nothing sweet or gourmand about this. Just a transparent, weightless wash of honest-to-goodness second hand cigarette smoke on the skin; sexy in a grimy, lived-in way that's difficult to explain to anyone who's never indulged. If you love Jeke by Slumberhouse, but want a summer-sheer version, then Smoke should be on your sample list."," Balkans Tobacco Leaves, Nicotine, Cade, Benjoin, Tonka Bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Haze Eau de Parfum,1786,Akro," Haze is the aromatic fog of a Bohemian cafÃ©, where the lurid green fairy of absinthe mingles with the sage-bush dryness of an illicit spliff. But surprisingly, before it is all this, it is a whirlwind brush with a kitchen garden after a downpour, a riotous vortex of crushed mint, snapped plant stems, and the herbal dewiness of clary sage. It smells like fresh lavender buds and wet soil, a winning mixture of sun-warmed herbs and the cool dampness of a spring shower. Deeply herbal and green, Haze slowly starts to dry out to the bittersweet, grassy smokiness that will later define it as a creature of the night. A boozy artemisia note adds that anisic, Pernod-like twang that still, years after absinthe was made legal again, feels quite naughty. The impression of marijuana is there, but subtly so, and certainly not enough to get you pulled over by the police. A softly smoky leather accent in the base ties it all together – pulling the scent from bright, wet, sunlit kitchen herbs to poetry reading in a Parisian cafÃ© in one easy, fluid arc. Sexy in a casually-tousled way, Haze is for those who like fresh and aromatic, but done with an irreverent twist."," Absinthe, Armoise, Eucalyptus, Spearmint, Clary Sage",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Molecule 02 Eau de Toilette,1657,Escentric Molecules," Ambroxan is the ingredient around which Molecule 02 orbits around exclusively (sister scent Escentric 02 blends the note with others). Natural ambroxan is one of the lusted after components of ambergris, the prohibitively costly, rare excretion of a sperm whale.  To be absolutely honest, when we tried this, we were shocked by its subtlety...and we mean subtle.  In fact, all we can smell is a smooth, skin-like, we-can't-put-our-finger-on-it fragrance afterthought that might as well be our own skin...but it isn't. There is a slight mineral-like edge to it but it's transparent and mild...if you're the type of person who can instantly tell the taste of plain water versus a mineral water like Evian, you'll instantly pick up on the gentle nuances of  Molecule 02. To sum it up, Molecule 02 is very light yet always present and hovering about four inches above where you applied it, especially after a few hours. The term“skin scent” has never been more embodied than in this perfume and we bet it will both fascinate and confuse perfume lovers for a long time to come. If there's anyone in your life who“can't stand perfume”, you've just found a little bottle of perfection for them.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escentric 02 Eau de Toilette,2257,Escentric Molecules," While its sister scent Molecule 02 is built around the single note of ambroxan (the manmade equivalent of costly natural ambergris), Escentric 02 blends the note with vetiver and the cruelty-free musk imposter muscone. Add just a touch of orris, elderflower extract and the sunny, jasmine-like feel of hedione and it's light, refreshing and yes, even brisk fragrance that sparkles and enchants from beginning to end.  It's the kind of brisk you think of when smelling a freshly poured gin and tonic over lots and lots of ice, only Escentric has a fascinating mineral-like finish that amps things up to super spectacular. It's a wear  anytime, go anywhere type of scent with a very relaxed, unassuming nature...utterly at ease, totally uncomplicated and easy going, we find ourselves reaching for it over and over when everything else just seems not quite right that day.  This one's too rich for the office, that one's too citrusy today, I'm not in a patchouli mood...ahhh, here's the perfect one!  Escentric 02 fits the bill every time.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lavender Extreme Eau de Parfum,1927,TOM FORD Private Blend," Fresh. Divergent. Stimulating.Tom Ford transcends the traditional limits of scent with Lavender Extreme. Lavender is reworked and refracted like is never has been before to become something irreverently new– a stunning, electric creation to be worn at maximum volume. Lavender is upended, translated from its storied origin in Provence and into a fresh subversion of itself. What We Think The normally relaxing scent of lavender gets a jolt of electricity in this intensely bright, invigoratingly modern fragrance with a sexy, spicy-warm tonka drydown."," Lemon, violet, lavender, geranium, rose, cinnamon, tonka Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Lavender Extreme by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Bana Banana Eau de Parfum,2334,L'Artisan Parfumeur," The story of Bana Banana is, unlikely as this may seem, the story of the creation of L'Artisan Parfumeur. In the 1970's, chemist and plant collector Jean-Francois Laporte was planning to attend the legendarily exuberant and creative Les Folies Bergeres, and needed to up the ante for his latest look, which was, of course, a banana costume. Drawing on his knowledge of natural materials, he created a banana scent for himself, and in the process he discovered a heretofore unknown passion for fragrance made with traditional methods and exceptional raw materials, a calling that would eventually result in his founding of L'Artisan Parfumeur with the help of master perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena. Now, in collaboration with his daughter Celine Ellena, L'Artisan resurrects that legendary scent, reimagined with all the style, skill, and quality for which the brand has become famous. Oh, but did we mention how unbelievably fun it is? The banana is rich, green, and fruity, surrounded with lively pepper and savory nutmeg, the floral aspects reinforced with milky jasmine and gently powdered iris and violet to coax the impression of ripe banana skin. Warm, tonka-infused amber foregrounds the fruit, lingering like the heat of the sun at dusk. Playful yet sophisticated, and rich in both character and history, Bana Banana is more than just a banana scent- it's the legacy of L'Artisan Parfumeur in a bottle."," Pepper, nutmeg, violet, jasmine, iris, banana, banana flower, tonka, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Easy To Love Eau de Parfum,1585,Eau d'Italie," One thing Italians love is an anniversary celebration. And so it's only fitting that the Eau d'Italie fragrance line, created 15 years ago to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Hotel Le Sireneuse Positano, has now begat a celebratory milestone of its own. Easy To Love, a love letter to fragrance, hospitality, and the stunning beauty of the Amalfi Coast, more than lives up to its name, wrapping us up in a lovely and soothing blend of fresh florals and juicy fig as seductive and timeless as Italy itself. It's a delightful example of quality over complication, with each note playing a vital role- white currant, sweeter than its better-known black and red siblings, still lends a distinctive tart buzz to the creamy, green fig note, made even fresher with a gentle peony. And lest we forget that la dolce vita is as much about sensory pleasures as it is the beauty of nature, Easy To Love features a luscious base of sweet honey, tonka bean, and subtly sensual ambrette musk- a nod to the food, drink, and romance one almost can't help but experience on the Mediterranean. If 15 years of Eau d'Italie resulted in a scent this carefree and wonderful, we can't wait to see what milestones we'll be celebrating next."," White currant, fig, white peony, honey, tonka, ambrette",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/43237.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cassili Eau de Parfum,2638,Parfums de Marly," At the intersection of desire and delicacy, Cassili is a fruity-floral beauty that reminds us that Parfums de Marly does feminine scents with every bit as much modern-meets-classic complexity as their much-heralded masculines. Exploding with triumphant fruitiness, yet anchored by a sophisticated woodsy gourmand base, Cassili is both fashion-forward and refined, with a true Parfums de Marly signature. From the first spray, Cassili leaps off the skin with joyful abandon, featuring mouthwatering notes of plum and redcurrant set against lushly textured florals- romantic rose, fresh mimosa and peachy plumeria, a delightful bouquet with enough sweetness to swoon over, but also enough floral firepower to seduce. As the complexly gourmand drydown- a creamy blend of vanilla and sandalwood- develops, we find ourselves completely under its spell. Fresh and sweet, classic and modern, fun and sexy- Cassili is a scent for women who don't need to compromise."," Red currant, rose, white flowers, plum, mimosa, plumeria, petalia, sandalwood, tonka, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70028.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ganymede Eau de Parfum,1415,Marc-Antoine Barrois," Ganymede, the rocky satellite of Jupiter discovered in 1610 by Galileo, both luminous and covered with salt-water oceans. In collaboration with Quentin Bisch, Marc-Antoine Barrois has dreamt of the essence of this new planet: an elegant and unexpected harmony around a quartet of mandarin, violet, immortelle and suede.Ganymede once again makes use of the suede-leathery notes that made their first collaboration, B683, an instant classic. This time though, the leather notes become softer, gaining lightness and gentleness in contact with the fragrance of violet. Mandarin still brings intense brightness and vivacity, yet immortelle adds sublime balance, using salty and mineralic tones to act as a striking counterpoint. A galactic olfactory harmony both delicate and balanced, full of energy, sensuality, and contrast, Ganymede is quite unlike any fragrance on the planet- or elsewhere. What We Think A saltier, more floral interpretation of the ultra-smooth top grain leather also featured in B683- airy but still substantial."," Mandarin, saffron, violet, osmanthus absolute, akigalawood, Immortelle absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/822001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 1 Tonic Blanc Eau de Parfum,2314,Thomas Kosmala," As fresh and as effortlessly elegant as a clean white shirt on a hot Sunday morning. No. 1 Tonic Blanc brilliantly captures neroli's quirk of being both juicy and bone-dry at the same time, like an orange squeezed into a glass of ice-cold vermouth. The neroli note is astonishingly pithy at first, its tartness boldly underlined by bergamot, mandarin, and the waxy green leafiness of the neroli itself. It's a slap in the face of heat.As the heart develops, the bitterness of the citrus notes is mellowed out with a softly honeyed orange blossom note and the cheerful brightness of mock orange. Yet, the scent never entirely devolves into the lush sweetness of white flowers. The sparkling, vermouth-like dryness that forms the core of the scent is shored up by a stirringly mossy, woodsy basenote and a musk that extends the just-washed linen muskiness of the neroli. This one's easy – a crisp, no-brainer neroli stunner for fighting your corner in the heat. Fantastic on both women and men."," bergamot, mandarin, orange, neroli, orange flower blossom, bergamot flower blossom, mock orange flower, oakmoss, sandalwood, cedarwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 2 Seve Nouvelle Eau de Parfum,1834,Thomas Kosmala," SÃ¨ve Nouvelle is the scent of new sap rising, of boundless energy roiling up and out - a sense of excitement that can no longer be contained. With its opening salvo of pink grapefruit effervescing upwards in a surge of creamy white soap bubbles, this cannot fail to make you smile. A playful raspberry brings a blush to the buttery saffron suede lying just beneath, while the joyous pop of champaca flower makes you think of those clear green shampoos that Wella Balsam made in the 1970's that were half-woods, half-Granny Smith apple. This peppery explosion of citrus and flowers fizzes brightly for a while before folding itself into a soft, incensey drydown that's almost creamy with amber and cashmeran. SÃ¨ve Nouvelle goes from spiky to fuzzy in one seamless swoop, a soft, raspberry-tinted putty note remaining in place all the way through. While this is a very modern take on fruit, flowers, and suede, a stirring wisp of temple incense in the base gives SÃ¨ve Nouvelle a stirring sense of the exotic and the familiar all at once."," grapefruit, pink pepper, saffron, champaca, tonka bean, water pepper, patchouli, raspberry, cashmeran, amberwood, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 3 Crepuscule Ardent Eau de Parfum,2322,Thomas Kosmala," CrÃ©puscule Ardent sets a smoky strand of red-gold saffron to smolder in an incense burner, while a temple attendant weaves jasmine blossoms through our hair. Echoes of a sweet Tuscan Leather-like aroma tease us, the heat magnifying the fug of soft leather, spice, and flowers until its fills the room. The intense aroma of saffron and jasmine is both pungent and creamy, like a lover's breath on the nape of the neck. CrÃ©puscule Ardent's sexy leather is bold, then increasingly soft and milky as an Arabian style amber settles in towards the base. Nothing sweet or syrupy, however – here, a, monumental frankincense note lends the scent a charcoal dust purity that cleanses the air and cuts through the fat. This is the scent that a Valkyrie wears as they stride towards the pyre, a glorious vision of black and gold light."," saffron, olibanum, jasmine, leather, suede, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 4 Apres l'Amour Eau de Parfum,1041,Thomas Kosmala," AprÃ¨s l'Amour is a 1960's Serge Gainsbourg song filtered through the synth pop sensibilities of the 1980's: candied lemon-rind musks and animalic notes suspended in a haze of modern woody-ambery aromachemicals. It smells like human skin after lovemaking – erotically charged, moist, musky – but thanks to a mesh of powerfully dry, smoky woods and electric ambers, broadcast at high volume to the rest of the world. It's this constant shifting of the scent from intimate to radiant and back to intimate again that makes AprÃ¨s l'Amour work. It seems to come with its own atmosphere - a crackle of electricity in the air; the rumbling of a storm to come. Utterly modern, even a bit brash, it's one of those my-skin-but-better fragrances that send out a subliminal message of attractiveness without you really knowing why or how. If you like scents such as Molecule 01 and Another 13, make sure you don't miss out on AprÃ¨s l'Amour."," bitter orange, lemon zest, aromatic notes, fresh spice, dry wood, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 5 Frenesie Eau de Parfum,2511,Thomas Kosmala," While most oud fragrances are proud and severe, their throaty, animalic rasp giving pause for thought, FrÃ©nÃ©sie is as soft and inviting as a freshly powdered bosom. Cowed into submission by an expansive floral bouquet dominated by an apricotty osmanthus, the oud is pushed to the edges of the scent, where it hums away sottovoce. Dressed up in this cloak of jammy florals, the oud is transformed into a glazed lychee tart that teeters on that quirky, Japanese-esque line between floral and fruity. The soft, gummy suede lurking beneath is the perfect counterpart to the syrupy osmanthus and roses, streaked here and there with a peppery peony bite. If we didn't know better, we'd swear there's violet in here too, casting an ethereal purple glow over the bouquet that holds it all together. Either way, the oud just a whisper, a faint trace of something woody in the lower register. A fuzzy haze of musk brings up the rear, diffusing the fudgy floral center into a spacey lightness. Lovely, and quite innocent-smelling."," saffron, bergamot, magnolia, rose, peony, osmanthus, gardenia, oud, amber, incense, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 6 Brume Radieuse Eau de Parfum,2674,Thomas Kosmala," Brume Radieuse proves that Thomas Kosmala has a particular sleight of hand when it comes to creating oud fragrances that depart from the norm. If FrÃ©nÃ©sie is a bon-bon of oud seen through a misty haze of jammy osmanthus, then Brume Radieuse is its equally floral, but grown-up sister, full of a simmering sensuality that makes you sit up straight in your chair. A bruise of blackcurrant juice – thick and tannic – stains the opening a deep purplish black and sets up a sexy fruity-rose beat that carries on throughout. At the heart, a nugget of salty black truffle – this would be the oud – is flanked on all sides by a chorus of juicy peach and coconut notes, the combination of which bears some resemblance to the mouthwatering aquatic-black chocolate accord that underpins Tom Ford's Black Orchid. A veritable riot of fruit, flowers, coconut, peach, and salty-earthy notes, Brume Radieuse shouldn't really work, and yet does. This is one sexy, feminine fruity-floral oud bomb that will not go without notice. The equivalent of that special black dress you wear like a weapon."," blackcurrant, peach, rose, coconut, jasmine, oud, patchouli, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 7 Le Sel de la Terre Eau de Parfum,1926,Thomas Kosmala," Le Sel de la Terre is proof that Leonardo da Vinci's assertion that“simplicity is the ultimate sophistication” is correct. Infuse a cloudy white musk with fresh lemon and crusty sea salt notes, and what you have is utter perfection. If it sounds trite or you think it's been done to death, then know that Kosmala's take distinguishes itself from the pack simply by virtue of smelling entirely natural, even when it is (clearly) not. The musk here is clean and sweet, a puff of laundry-hot air strangely unblemished by the chemical twang of cleaning solvents and enlivened with an expensive-smelling medley of lemon and bergamot. Le Sel de la Terre is a white shirt freshly pulled from the dryer, draped on a clean body, and generously doused in Monsieur Balmain, a paragon of elegance in its pairing of blond wood and citrus. A salty undertone is just enough to suggest the mineral tang of the beach without making you think of Calone or Ambroxan. Fantastic. We know what we're drenching ourselves this summer."," bergamot, Italian lemon, fresh marine notes, aqua, fresh floral, fresh wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 8 Tonic Vert Eau de Parfum,1327,Thomas Kosmala," Tonic Vert is a true tonic for the winter blues. With its crushed mint and sour citrus topnotes, the scent starts out with the stinging clarity of early morning sunshine cutting across a dark room. Unlike other green fragrances, it is neither soapy-soft or sappy-juicy. Rather, it is dry, dry, dry throughout, an essential bitterness focusing the mind and straightening the spine. Yet this is not a classic green scent like No. 19 or even Green Irish Tweed – Tonic Vert makes a feature of its modern single-mindedness. Though more naturalistic than abstract or synthetic, it nonetheless manages to convey an impression of crisp angularity that feels more at home in a boardroom than on a ramble through the fields. The combination of that earthy, bitter vetiver with the strange pink fruitiness of pomelo and the minty rosiness of geranium is arresting to the nth degree: in the murky darkness of deep winter, you'll want to spray this over and over just to let the light in again."," bergamot, lemon, mandarin, lime, mint, geranium, pomelo, vetiver, musk, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
No. 9 Bukhoor Elixir de Parfum,1361,Thomas Kosmala," Bukhoor, or bakhoor as it is sometimes known, is the Arabic name for woodchips that have been soaked in precious essential oils, mixed with shards of frankincense and other resins, and finally pressed into soft, brownish bricks to be smoked slowly over an incense burner. All over the Middle East, bukhoor is burned generously to banish domestic smells of cooking and to make the home smell warm and welcoming to visitors. Bukhoor, Thomas Kosmala's take on the theme, honors its source material by being rich, smoky, and pugnacious, with an Arabic personality that's surprisingly authentic. The animalic bite of aged Hindi oud hits the nose first, its characteristic aroma of raw leather, and slightly dirty hay burning a blaze across the olfactory landscape. The scent mellows considerably in the base, where it takes a turn for dry and smoky, a smoldering woods note infusing the atmosphere with the marvelous scent of burnt paper, benzoin, and brown sugar. A bold, no-holds-barred take on an ancient material, and one that proves Kosmala's skill in handling it."," woody accords, smoky accords, agarwood, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Beaute du Diable Eau de Parfum,1353,Liquides Imaginaires," ""Would you be willing to sell your soul to the Devil to possess his perfume? This essence is part of his powers, of his eternal seduction."" So reads Liquides Imaginaires' tagline for Beaute du Diable, a spicy, sweet, richly aromatic concoction that opens like a perfect gin on the rocks before taking a turn into richly spicy florals and aromatic cypress before settling into a dusty, smoky, smolderingly sexy fragrance that's as irresistible as it is hard to define. Picture the devil as a gorgeously androgynous figure in an immaculately tailored suit strolling towards you down a gaslamp-lit cobblestone alley, a puff of smoke rising from the street with each footstep. You're nervous, but intrigued, and as soon as their scent hits your nose, you know that for tonight, at least, you're going to go wherever they want you to go. That's the seductive, mysterious power of Beaute du Diable."," Lemon, coriander, bitter orange, gin accord, absinthe, clove, cypress, geranium, ylang ylang, carnation, vetiver, gaiac, cistus, cobblestone accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73218.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Monarch Extrait de Parfum,2221,Bortnikoff," Plenty of fragrances are powerful or complex, but what makes a scent truly regal? In the case of Oud Monarch, the answer is power and complexity in the service of pure, indulgent, delightful comfort. Just as Areej Le Dore's Oud Luwak gave us the why-didn't-we-think-of-that savory voluptuousness of oud and coffee, so too does Oud Monarch delve deep into gourmand territory, delivering a richly mouthwatering cocoa-infused oud scent as luxuriously smooth as the finest royal vestments. While the oud on display is as precious and potent as in any scent we carry (as with all Bortnikoff ouds, it features frequent collaborator Russian Adam's treasured and rare ""Feel Oud""), the introduction of a rich cacao note does a miraculous thing, smoothing the animalic roar of the oud into a smooth and delicious purr that still resonates with power. It's so blissfully intense that it truly takes a moment for your nose to adjust, at which point you can appreciate the masterful attention to detail behind the potency- smooth, sweet florals, spiced tobacco and resin- all perfectly pitched to keep every sniff unique and intriguing. Oud lovers, chocolate fanatics, come together: here is a fragrance fit for a Monarch."," Magnolia, Frangipani, Rose de Mai, Himalayan Rose, Cinnamon, Tobacco, Oud Merauke, Oud co Chang (Feel-oud), Cacao, Civet, Castoreum, Labdanum, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Cologne Eau de Parfum,1062,Bortnikoff," What makes Bortnikoff scents so special is not merely the inclusion of exceptional materials, but the vision required to do something novel and amazing with them. Take Amber Cologne, which features an impressive amount of real grey and brown ambergris, in all of its richly mineralic salty-sweet glory. It's an increasingly rare star player in perfume, so who in their right mind would put it into an ordinary citrus-and-woods cologne? It seems Bortnikoff would, and the results turn out to be far from ordinary. It doesn't hurt that the citrus in question is eye-poppingly fresh, an arresting blend of juicy bergamot, zesty lemon, sweet orange, and deliciously tart grapefruit, making the mouth water and the senses ignite. And once ignited, we find ourselves primed for the most gorgeously comfortable blend of ambergris and woods we could ever hope for- salty and gently animalic, to be sure, but moreover simply aglow with a luminous warmth that drills through every level of artifice in your memory to connect with the perfect ideal of sun-kissed skin at the beach- soft, smooth, and unbelievably sexy. Flourishes of florals and real oud provide support and structure, coaxing every last aspect from the ambergris, which glows for untold hours of sheer bliss. Perhaps the easiest-to-wear Bortnikoff yet, Amber Cologne is a simple, wonderful idea executed with flawless mastery and unparalleled quality."," Bergamot, Lemon, White and Pink Grapefruit, Sweet Orange, Cardamom, Frangipani, Jasmine Sambac, Virginia Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Grey and Brown Ambergris, Oud from Sri Lanka, Bouya Oud, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Musk Khabib Extrait de Parfum,1765,Bortnikoff," Musk Khabib isn't so much a fragrance as an experience. Sure, it's a wonderfully opulent chypre built on bright bergamot, spicy florals, and a rich yet fresh base of moss and musk the likes of which are rarely seen in modern perfumery. But we can't shake the feeling that it wasn't even meant to wear in public, but rather for the true perfume lover to lock themselves away from the world and apply heavily, shaking with giddy delight as each sniff brings a wholly novel combination of its featured notes: one moment intensely bright and spicy, the next warm and animalic, then perhaps creamy and sweet, and back again- an overflowing and ever-replenishing treasure chest of olfactory riches. It's a collector's scent, the kind you'll vacillate between wanting to use up in a single day and save forever. Lovers of Areej Le Dore's Russian Musk, and those who never got a chance to try it, your opportunity to exult in a truly vintage-style musk scent has come around again. Don't miss it."," Bergamot, Cardamom, Nutmeg, Ylang-Ylang, Cedarwood, Tolu Balsam, Ambergris, Deer Musk, Oakmoss, Vetiver, Tonka Bean, Vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sensual Instinct Eau de Parfum,1569,Montale," Lush, sweet, and deeply intoxicating, Sensual Instinct is a journey through a kaleidoscopic fantasyland where mouthwatering fruit, romantic florals, and rich gourmand notes intertwine with uncontrollable abandon. A must-have for lovers of truly full-bodied fragrance, it's an explosion of deeply resonant, highly colorful scents certain to get your pulse racing. Every moment is full of contrast and serendipitous pairings, as an opening of ultra-bright bergamot and mandarin is matched with sweet, smooth cardamom and boozy whiskey. As the ambered, lushly drawn florals of the heart notes swell, so too does a delectable tiramisu accord, all set against a rich, gently earthy patchouli. And as the gourmand base of coffee, cacao, and vanilla intensifies, so too does the seductive power of this unforgettable scent. Lose yourself in the delicious haze of Sensual Instinct- your body knows what to do."," Bergamot, mandarin, cardamom, saffron, whisky, amberwood, jasmine, rose, tiramisu, patchouli leaves, cacao, coffee, vanilla, oakmoss, cedarwood, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vetiver Patchouli Eau de Parfum,1024,Montale," With so much attention paid to Montale's rich, complex florientals and gourmands, it's easy to forget how well they do fresh and spicy (hello Red Vetiver!). And so it is with great pleasure that we introduce Vetiver Patchouli, a fiercely bright and fiery spicy-fresh fragrance that ignites the senses and invigorates the spirit. From the eye-popping burst of citrus and pink pepper in the opening to the surprising combination of gently sweet carrot, rich jasmin grandiflorum, and woodsy patchouli of the heart, and finally, the complexity of the spicy, woodsy, delicately earthy vetiver base, which lingers for hours with a sheer masculine sensuality that, truth be told, is every bit as captivating on a woman who prefers action to talk. While we're never upset with any new release from this venerable house, let us be the first to say: welcome back, Fresh Montale. We've missed you."," Bergamot, mandarin, pink pepper, carrot, jasmine, patchouli, vetiver, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Dream Eau de Parfum,1127,Montale," When one thinks of a Montale oud, lavishly exotic and over-the-top cocktails of fruit and musk come to mind. And while those are wonderful, Oud Dream is a different sort of oud scent, a delicately sweet and spicy musky oud better suited for a romantic night under the desert stars instead of a disco ball, no matter what it might look like on the bottle. The key difference is a lovely touch of restraint- notes like ""sweet honey"" and black pepper are, in fact, handled deftly, never sticky-sweet or nose-crunchingly spicy. Even the rose-oud of the heart is toned down from the opulence of Roses Musk, feeling smooth and romantic and keeping you leaning in for more. Don't get us wrong- there's still a place for the opulence of Montale's other oud scents. But once the sun sets, the situation calls for a touch of elegance- and that's when Oud Dream has its chance to shine."," Bergamot, cardamom, coriander, black pepper, sweet honey, rose, oud, patchouli, cedar, leather, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Holy Water Eau de Parfum,1089,La Via Del Profumo," A rose-and-sandal attar in the body of a French eau de cologne. In the Middle East and India, some attars are composed specifically to protect the soul from djinns, or evil spirits. In the West, we use citrusy colognes to refresh the body in hot weather. Both concepts are rooted in the belief that certain materials in perfumery possess an excoriating, cleansing power to drive out bad spirits and bad smells. Abdes Salaam Attar's Holy Water (Aqua Santa) is a perfume  bridge between the Eastern concept of purifying one's soul and the Western concept of refreshing the physical. In pairing a bitter orange note with a dusty, ethereal frankincense, and placing it all in the context of a fresh eau de cologne, Holy Water emerges as a true hybrid between the Eastern and Western ”˜eaux de protection'. It's an almost medieval idea, but it works perfectly. A sweet, carefree orange blossom note gentles the piney austerity of the frankincense, softening what could have been an angular church incense into a hazy cloud of fruit, rose, and sandalwood. Although more fresh than sweet, Holy Water has a pleasing marshmallowy softness at its core that mitigates the impact of the tougher resinous and woody notes. It smells clean, vigorous, and above all, spiritually uplifting. Apply generously in times of sadness, melancholy, or simply when the greyness of the sky is wearing you down. Holy Water is a shot of sunshine delivered straight to your soul."," frankincense, sandalwood, orange, orange blossom, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mecca Balsam Eau de Parfum,2429,La Via Del Profumo," Opening on a rich, smoky stew of incense over the crackle of dried tobacco leaf, Mecca Balsam sends the senses reeling, as if you'd suddenly stepped into the scent trail of a thousand pilgrims holding burning censers aloft as they circle the Black Stone in Mecca. Despite the tarry heft of the sticky balsams and resins, there is an airy sweetness to the underlying structure – a sort of smoked-out incense fairy dust – that elevates the scent and keeps it airborne. A common complaint leveled at incense scents is that they feel cold or severe, but there's no danger of that here. Dubrana has balanced the ancient salve-like feel of the incense with a musky, saline labdanum that reads like warm skin, in one stroke banishing any thought of High Church and drawing our mind instead to what he originally intended Mecca Balsam to reflect: the seething mass of human souls gathered around the Kaaba to perform the Hajj. Mecca Balsam is both sacred and divine, therefore, pitching the throat-catching aridity of incense against the warm, sweet embrace of flowers and amber. Unusual in that it simultaneously purifies and comforts, Mecca Balsam feels less like perfume than it does a statement of faith."," Indian tuberose, tobacco, rose, benzoin, agarwood, incense, labdanum, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81604.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Milano Caffe Eau de Parfum,2149,La Via Del Profumo," Milan is a city that prides itself on the uncompromising purity of its espresso, and in Milano CaffÃ©, the roasted bitterness of the bean meets its match in a square of viciously dark chocolate. If you've ever sipped an espresso while nibbling on a bar of 80% cacao chocolate, then you'll be familiar with the dark, burnt edge that connects them on the Venn diagram of taste. Dubrana feeds it to us straight for a while – no sugar or milk – and it's so intense that little sips are in order. Earthy and bold, the scent's velvety thickness wraps around us like the steamy vapors in a Milanese coffee house. Slowly, the master eases up on the intensity of the coffee-cocoa double whammy, drip-feeding a powdery iris into the mix like a tip of the milk jug. This is followed closely by the mocha almond creamer of tonka bean. Now we move out of pure espresso territory and into the creamy, cocoa-sprinkled milkiness of a cappuccino. It's rich but definitely not sweet, a hint of fiery cinnamon in the opoponax lending a nubbin of spice that adds texture to the silken flow. A dash of incense additionally lends an interesting salt-n-pepper tartness that stops any gourmandise in its tracks. Still incredibly indulgent, Milano CaffÃ© is the tira-mi-su (meaning ”˜pick-me-up' in Italian) the adults in the room have been waiting for."," coffee, cappuccino, chocolate, iris, woody notes, spicy notes, opoponax, tonka bean, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oakmoss Eau de Parfum,1896,La Via Del Profumo," Oakmoss (Quercia di Muschio) is deceptively named, because, despite the clear presence of oakmoss, this scent is far more about vetiver than moss. Still, the genius of the fragrance – for us – lies in the fact that Dominique Dubrana has obviously mined the areas of convergence between these two materials to emerge with a creature that has a foot in both worlds. Thus, the marine-like inkiness of the oakmoss connects with the rooty earthiness of vetiver via the crunch of sea salt and a shadowy ”˜forest floor' gloom. In the background, a dry, minimally smoky sandalwood provides a palette against which the notes of earth, grass, root, and lichen can really pop. Strangely, for a scent so heavily inspired by the elements of earth, grass, moss, and wood, Oakmoss is far more elegant and ”˜pulled together' than the kind of scent you'd throw on for a hike in the woods. In fact, its crisp, tailored lines make it a perfect candidate for formal office wear. But however you choose to use it, the fact remains that Oakmoss is a riveting distillation of everything rooty, wet, and green in the forest. We find it to be soul-restoring and exciting in equal measure."," vetiver, sandalwood, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Caravan No. 1 Eau de Parfum,2741,La Via Del Profumo," Abdes Salaam Attar's Oud Caravan series is the world's first (and probably only) crowd-sourced oud perfume collection. Commissioned by an Arab customer to compose an oud perfume for the Gulf region, Dominique Dubrana decided to make it an open source project, enlisting the help of a group of oud connoisseurs on Basenotes.com to stress-test his offering. Oud Caravan No. 1 was originally intended to be the sole perfume in the endeavor – what Dubrana termed ”˜the Ultimate Oud Fragrance” – but like a really good conversation with a circle of friends, nobody wanted it to end. Riffing off each other in endlessly creative ways, Dubrana harnessed the energy of the group to create the first, then second, and finally third Oud Caravan. Today, all three Oud Caravan perfumes fit together thematically and sequentially as a cohesive statement on the mysterious material that is oud oil.Oud Caravan No. 1 was composed to provide the oud beginner with a primer on what the material actually smells like. To this end, the perfume amalgamates several key characteristics of different oud terroirs and blends them into a seamless whole to give the wearer an idea of the real deal, without compromising on wearability. In Oud Caravan No. 1, the camphoraceous, minty bite of a Borneo-style oud gives the opening a punchy freshness that contrasts delightfully with the animalistic warmth of the aged Indian oud that lies just beneath. Imagine a Bengali tiger and what he smells like: you sense the clean fur of the animal himself, but also the peppery heat of his breath and the dried-straw inkiness of his dung. Indian oud, especially the aged stuff, as used here, is the stuff of Kings - as noble as it is ferociously animalic. Spicy, masculine, and leathery are the three words we'd choose to describe this statement-making scent. Wear it to mark your territory."," natural aged oud oil, camphor, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Caravan No. 2 Eau de Parfum,2762,La Via Del Profumo," Abdes Salaam Attar's Oud Caravan series is the world's first (and probably only) crowd-sourced oud perfume collection. Commissioned by an Arab customer to compose an oud perfume for the Gulf region, Dominique Dubrana decided to make it an open source project, enlisting the help of a group of oud connoisseurs on Basenotes.com to stress-test his offering. Oud Caravan No. 1 was originally intended to be the sole perfume in the endeavor – what Dubrana termed ”˜the Ultimate Oud Fragrance” – but like a really good conversation with a circle of friends, nobody wanted it to end. Riffing off each other in endlessly creative ways, Dubrana harnessed the energy of the group to create the first, then second, and finally third Oud Caravan. Today, all three Oud Caravan perfumes fit together thematically and sequentially as a cohesive statement on the mysterious material that is oud oil.Oud Caravan No. 2 was born out of the suggestions from Dubrana's testing group that No. 1 was simply too leathery, dry, and masculine to win over women. Dubrana listened carefully. After all, his avowed mission with Oud Caravan No. 1 had been to make The Ultimate Oud Fragrance that would sweep newcomers to oud oil, including women, off their feet and expose them to the glory of natural oud. Oud Caravan No. 2 handles the animalistic, barnyardy qualities of oud oil in a much lighter fashion, softening its leathery rudeness with an earthy vanilla and a subdued floral note, something creamy and pale like freshly-opened tuberose buds. The topnotes, similar to No. 1, open with a medicinal, stemmy freshness, which this time seems to come from tuberose rather than from Borneo oud. Although still unmistakably oudy, Oud Caravan No. 2 is an ethereal, dewy take on a famously gruff material – something that Arwen from Lord of The Rings might wear."," natural aged, wild Bengali oud oil, white flowers, Laotian oud oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81609.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Oud Caravan No. 3 Eau de Parfum,2040,La Via Del Profumo," Abdes Salaam Attar's Oud Caravan series is the world's first (and probably only) crowd-sourced oud perfume collection. Commissioned by an Arab customer to compose an oud perfume for the Gulf region, Dominique Dubrana decided to make it an open source project, enlisting the help of a group of oud connoisseurs on Basenotes.com to stress-test his offering. Oud Caravan No. 1 was originally intended to be the sole perfume in the endeavor – what Dubrana termed ”˜the Ultimate Oud Fragrance” – but like a really good conversation with a circle of friends, nobody wanted it to end. Riffing off each other in endlessly creative ways, Dubrana harnessed the energy of the group to create the first, then second, and finally third Oud Caravan. Today, all three Oud Caravan perfumes fit together thematically and sequentially as a cohesive statement on the mysterious material that is oud oil.Oud Caravan No. 3 is the culmination of Dubrana's work on the Caravan series, and the version he feels best encapsulates his vision of a universally-pleasing oud scent. Removing the sharp camphoraceous topnotes that presaged both Caravan No. 1 and No. 2, Dubrana envelops the wild agarwood oil in a warm, fudgy date-like sweetness, using dried fruit and amber notes to subtly nudge the texture dial from leather to velvet. Rich and mellow, Oud Caravan No. 3 goes down smoothly, like a 50-year-old Scotch. Remarkably, Dubrana has steered the oudiness of this scent away from the jungly wetness of the first two scents and towards an airiness that feels like the windows being thrown open onto a closed-up room. As smoky as it is rich, Oud Caravan No. 3 is just animalic enough to remind you that you're wearing real oud, but smooth enough for you to enjoy it without the steep learning curve. As great for women as it is for men."," Natural aged wild Bengali oud oil, dates, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81610.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Chocolate Eau de Parfum,1910,La Via Del Profumo," Amber Chocolate is a lush gourmand amber that should come with a sticker that reads“for grown-ups only”. Put aside any thoughts you might have of the kind of yummy vanilla-and-berries smell surrounding young girls like a nuclear cloud – this is seriously dark and sexy stuff. A molten dark chocolate note gets buffed out into an almondy haze of tonka bean, hints of hay and roast hazelnut flirting with the cacao to give it a slightly bitter, non-edible edge that sets it apart from other gourmands. The fact that this delicious scent is all-natural and artisanal means that it's a guilt-free indulgence. Despite the almost comically simple name, Amber Chocolate is not a simple affair. There's a naughty musk or patchouli here that gives the texture a resinous, grainy aftertaste, like gianduja rolled up in a veiny Cuban tobacco leaf. We think it's the real vanilla absolute that's been used in Amber Chocolate. Woody and resolutely non-sweet, it lends a boozy depth that reads in some lights as brandy or amaretto. Amber Chocolate's bitter cacao juxtaposes the golden sweetness of amber so effectively that even the amber-averse might be tempted. But honestly, if you ever loved or bought a bottle of Bruno Fazzolari's Ummagumma, Slumberhouse Ore, or Guerlain's Gourmand Coquin, then this boozy chocolate amber is 100% for you."," chocolate, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hindu Kush Eau de Parfum,2073,La Via Del Profumo," Hindu Kush takes its name and inspiration from the 500-mile mountain range running along the hinterlands of Afghanistan, Kashmir, and Pakistan, characterized by wild pine forests that give way to jagged mountain peaks. The scent mirrors the sensory contrast between forest and stone to perfection, capturing in particular the chilly isolation of rugged places unreachable to most humans. It is a meditative scent that taps into our need for silence and contemplation.  The contrasts in Hindu Kush are what drive the scent. In pairing the cool lemon-and-pine notes of pure frankincense with the fiery heat of ginger, nutmeg, and pepper, Hindu Kush achieves an incredible fire-and-ice character that captures our interest throughout. Resinous, mossy woods create the impression of oiled floorboards, a smell that is both comforting and nostalgic. The incense notes are smoky and balsamic, but the freshness of pine leaves drags the priest's censer out of the chapel and into the forest clearing. It's a scent of worship, yes, but here we're worshipping at the altar of Nature herself. Picture ancient warriors cooking heavily spiced meat over fires, surrounded by the howling ice winds of the Hindu Kush, and you get an idea of the mysterious alchemy between the culinary and the spiritual at play here. We can think of nothing quite like it."," spice, woody notes, incense, ginger, caraway, nutmeg, pepper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aenotus Parfum Extrait,2158,Puredistance," On a rocky bluff at the edge of the mythical isle of Aeolia, a mythic God tends to the divine winds. At a moment's notice, he is ready to release them in all their elemental force, to sweep across the lands of ancient Europe, carrying in their embrace the contrasting powers of creation and destruction. This is the power of Aenotus, itself a fragrance of contrast: freshness and warmth, comfort and primal power. While Puredistance founder Jan Ewoud Vos has a personal connection to every scent, Aenotus was conceived to be his signature- a scent that had to be instantly refreshing, while also presenting a rich, long-lasting second phase more sophisticated than your average ""fresh"" scent. And with the help of master perfumer Antoine Lie, Aenotus delivers, wowing us with an eye-popping, euphoric burst of complex citrus and mint notes that smoothly flows into a warm, deeply sensual base of mossy skin musk that lingers on skin for hours and clothes for days. This rare achievement is possible via Puredistance's no-matter-the-cost philosophy, as Aenotus boasts an astounding, unprecedented 48% perfume oil concentration developed over three painstaking years. Was it worth it?

Tabac Eau de Parfum,1077,La Via Del Profumo," Tobacco fragrances often get the ”˜weight' thing wrong. Too much amber or vanilla, and it sinks under the heft of its own richness, but too light and it feels like a sheer wash of ash on the skin. Tabac by Abdes Salaam Attar gets it right by pairing a bold tobacco leaf with a sheer dried-fruit amber and a bitter, earthy vanilla - elements that serve to modulate each other's behavior and sidestep any excessive sweetness. The tobacco leaf in Tabac is raw and uncured, even a bit rough around the edges. Its honest-to-goodness rustic charm is complemented by the quasi-animalic woodiness of sticky black vanilla pod and the buttery, cherry-almond bitterness of tonka bean. As you might imagine, the result is incredibly rich. But fear not! The resinous amber underpinning the tobacco, vanilla, and tonka bean crown is so dry that there's no danger of this tipping over into syrup. Tabac is simply vigorous, handsome, and very well-built. It's the perfect mid-weight tobacco perfume: substantial enough to be satisfying and spacious enough to wear without feeling crushed under the weight of super-rich materials. In a word – suave."," tobacco, vanilla, tonka bean, labdanum, spicy notes, resins",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Molecule 03 Eau de Toilette,1615,Escentric Molecules," As with the first two pairs, launched in 2006 and 2008, Schoen has designed two new scents as homages to a single scent ingredient, or aroma-chemical.  What Molecule 01 did for ISO E Super and Molecule 02 did for Ambroxan, Molecule 03 does for vetiveryle acetate.Ultimate is an overused word. Some bandy it about, announcing that something or other is the ultimate sports car, the ultimate cabernet, the ultimate restaurant. However, we can with confidence write that Molecule 03 is the ultimate vetiver. The aroma-chemical in Molecule 03 is vetiveryle acetate, a stark, clinical name for a vetiver note which is celebrated in its purest form in this fragrance. Amazingly, this single note runs the gamut of all aspects of vetiver.    Molecule 03 opens with a heady, sparkling brightness that develops into a rooty earthiness. As it melts into your skin, it contrasts with the slightly sweet and very green heart that is a hallmark of this perennial grass native to India. It has that yin and yang of cold and hot; it's a skin scent with a sly sillage.  Were it jewelry it would be a single, flawless emerald in a simple platinum setting, a thing of beauty and perhaps the most perfect vetiver you've ever experienced. Vetiver lovers: your ship has come in.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30808.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escentric 03 Eau de Toilette,1520,Escentric Molecules," Escentric 03 is a tribute to the more familiar side of vetiver: its dark, slightly exotic woodiness. The fragrance opens with a burst of freshness – the ginger root is joined by top notes of green peppercorn and Mexican lime.The heart of orris is surrounded by Egyptian jasmine and soft tea notes. Then, at the base of the fragrance, the slightly bitter notes of vetiver are smoothed by rich amber shades of sandalwood, cedar, leather and musk.The overall impression is spicy but fresh with warm balsamic undertones, like a traditional chypre. It's sensuous without sweetness, which is a signature by perfumer Geza Schoen.

Elixir Pour Femme Extrait de Parfum,2086,Roja Parfums," While Roja Dove's reputation as the king of fine fragrance comes from his ability to create scents that conjure the bygone glory of pre-regulation grandeur, he's no less adept at delivering sleeker scents that still hum with high-end luxury. Elixir Pour Femme, a smoothly soft, sweet, fruit-infused stunner that exudes Roja's signature richness with a decidedly fresher, more modern profile. Elixir's signature interplay between fresh and lush is evident from the very beginning, as a bergamot brightness merely sets the tone for a dynamic bouquet featuring lily of the valley, rose, ylang, and heliotrope, sweetened with mouthwatering notes of raspberry and peach.

Cuir Mauresque Eau de Parfum,1191,Serge Lutens," Each release of Serge Lutens' Palais-Royale exclusives into the export line is an eagerly awaited event and with this season's Cuir Mauresque, aficionados will, at last, be able to revel in the definitive Oriental leather, in the line of Caron's mythical Tabac Blond with spices added.This isn't the tough, rawhide pungency rising from Marrakech tanneries, but the smoothest, fatty-rich leather rubbed in flowers and a sweet spice blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin and clove infused with the fragrant smoke of incense and myrrh rising from censers. Sweetened by orange blossom, mandarin peel and amber, Cuir Mauresque gives off a tawny, ember-like glow. The leather accord itself is produced by burnt styrax, a balsamic material with tarry, animalic facets; clove, incense and aloe wood add a dark, burnt edginess to the accord, while civet pulls it towards the animal.With its spiced dried fruit accord, resins and white flowers, Cuir Mauresque, originally launched in 1996, is perhaps the quintessential Lutens: the master himself has gone on record saying he doused himself in on the rare occasions when he goes out.  And considering the choice he's got, that's saying quite a lot. What We Think Spicy, powdery, and animalic, this is a delightfully sexy secret weapon of a fragrance."," amber, myrrh, burnt styrax, incense, cinnamon, aloe wood, cedar, civet, nutmeg, clove, cumin, musk, mandarin peel, orange blossom",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36140.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chene Eau de Parfum,1864,Serge Lutens," If you thought the oak, beeswax and rum notes would take you in Uncle Serge's secret Western-style den – the one with the polished heirloom furniture where he trades mint tea for a tipple – you'd be very much mistaken...  ChÃªne is quintessentially Lutens: dried fruit, spices and wood.In ChÃªne (French for oak), each note seems to mesh with the others to create a flammable mixture drenched in woody saps and resins... The fruity booziness of the oak, rum and immortelle segues, through the latter's tobacco and honey notes, into the beeswax and tonka bean. The smokiness of the tonka bean echoes that of the birch tar and oak. The bone-dry, pencil-shavings cedar is suffused with the aromatic camphor of the black thyme and the underlying bitterness of the oak tannins is nestled in an“undergrowth note” which chypre aficionados will recognize as... oak moss. In fact, ChÃªne is probably the closest Serge Lutens and Christopher Sheldrake have come to composing an aromatic leather chypre, in their trademark oriental-style. What We Think Rich, woodsy, and delightfully long lasting, this is a masterpiece for any cedar lovers."," cedar crystals, wood sap, black thyme, oak, immortelle, beeswax, silver birch, rum absolute and tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36129.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fumerie Turque Eau de Parfum,1056,Serge Lutens," An eagerly-awaited inclusion in the exports line (aren't they all?), Fumerie Turque evocatively weaves references to the honeyed tobaccos smoked in the seraglios of the Ottoman empire and the exotic cigarettes flaunted by the GarÃ§onnes in the gender-bending 1920s. It can't be too much of a stretch to envision Fumerie Turque as Serge Lutens' tribute to Caron's trailblazing Tabac Blond – albeit with his trademark Oriental twist.Smokey wisps of honeyed, fruity tobacco rise from a smooth, vanilla-flavored blend of tonka bean, styrax and Peru balsam, conjuring lazy winter afternoons smoking a hookah and nibbling rose-scented Turkish delights in a leather-paneled room. The rich, floral, faintly animal odor of beeswax rises from floors strewn with ornate rugs and polished daybeds. The scent of late-blooming jasmine wafts up from the palace gardens. Through the intricate wooden lace of a musharabieh, the Bosphorus glints in the sunset. Intoxicating and comforting, Fumerie Turque is the ultimate Orientalist reverie in a bottle. Succumb. What We Think Sweet, fresh pipe tobacco with surprisingly lush florals- a truly romantic unisex tobacco scent."," Corinthian raisins, white honey, candied Turkish rose, Egyptian jasmine, smoked leather, beeswax, Balkan tobacco, Peru Balsam, patchouli, tonka bean, styrax, juniper tar oil.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36130.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Muscs Koublai Khan Eau de Parfum,1898,Serge Lutens," Musk, highly evocative of the most extraordinary scents imaginable; China, precious gold, opium dens. Refinement, cruelty... senses complex in their contradictions.KoublaÃ¯ KhÃ¤n, the Great Mongol ruler, Emperor of China. This Son of Heaven had a hill raised in the grounds of his palace, on top of which stood a lacquer and jade contemplation pavilion. The mound was planted with rare trees, kept green whatever the season. The ground was covered with glistening malachite and lapis lazuli particles... a coating of crystal. Muscs KoublaÃ¯ KhÃ¤n – a sensual, undulating aura. An animalesque scent. What We Think A cult classic of the animalic musk genre, MKK returns to Luckyscent with every bit of the rich, seductive growl it made its name with. Almost unbelievably sexy."," Vegetal Musk, Roots of Costus, Labdanum Rockrose, Grey Amber, Vanilla, Patchouli, Ambrette Seeds, pure Moroccan Rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36136.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tubereuse Criminelle Eau de Parfum,1053,Serge Lutens," At last, Serge Lutens' mythical TubÃ©reuse Criminelle makes a break from the Palais Royal in this season's limited edition!Its surprisingly addictive minty-camphoraceous top notes are due to the Tiger Balm-ish smell of methyl salicylate, a molecule naturally present in the tuberose... Instead of taming their fierceness, Serge Lutens asked the perfumer Christopher Sheldrake to unleash it. But after this olfactory assault, the tuberose opens up its creamy heart, made richer still with its white floral sisters jasmine and orange blossom, contrasted with the green-rosy, indolic notes of hyacinth. A rich oriental base anchors it to the skin, the styrax underlining the almost leathery undertones of the tuberose, nutmeg and clove boosting its slow burn...Thus, the diva of the garden lives up to her reputation: first a slap, then a kiss... The rest, we'll leave entirely up to you. What We Think A dynamically minty take on tuberose for all the camphor lovers out there."," tuberose, jasmine, orange blossom, hyacinth, nutmeg, clove, styrax, musk, vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36151.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Serge Noire Eau de Parfum - ...,1918,Serge Lutens," A phoenix, the mythical bird of legend burns at the height of its splendour before emerging triumphant, reborn from the ashes in a choreography of flame, conjuring the shapes of yesterday in a dance of ashes. The swirls of oriental grey enrich the twilight with depth and intensity while windswept memories hint at the beauty of transformation.An ode to everlasting beauty under cover of night's rich plumage. What We Think This enchantingly spicy and dark stunner is perfect for men or women who love cinnamon and clove (both feature players here) but don't want to smell like dessert."," patchouli, cinnamon, amber and black woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36122.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Louve Eau de Parfum - ...,2891,Serge Lutens," The newest Lutens creation, Louve, is the softest, gentlest, perhaps the most loveable of the entire line. It is a lunar scent, quiet and tranquil...tender like baby's breath, soft like the white fur of a mythical She-Wolf...The almond and rose petals accord, the center of the composition, is bound to satisfy the cravings of those who love loukhoum-inspired scents. Those who tend to avoid gourmand compositions because of their overwhelming sweetness, should, however, give Louve a serious try. This understated, only subtly sweet, sublimely elegant blend will change your mind. The slight powderiness of vanilla and amber, combined with the floral heart, gives Louve an enchantingly retro feel, making us think of expensive lipsticks of the days past, of the finest of face powders and of utter refinement. Chic and delicious...what more could you want from a fragrance! What We Think More fresh almond than most scents with the rose-almond-vanilla combination, this classic still feels romantic, youthful, and fun."," Almond, rose petals, fruity notes, jasmine petals, amber, musk and vanilla powder.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36120.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
De Profundis Eau de Parfum,2206,Serge Lutens," From the depths, I have cried out to you, O Lord! Inspired in part by Psalm 130, De Profundis is a love poem to resurrection, both of the soul and of nature. This fragrance opens on a thrilling note of new plant growth pushing rudely through wet soil, ripping its way into the weak sunshine. A haze of violets, chrysanthemums, muguet, and hyacinth chills the wearer like a dawn mist, creating a floral harmony so beautiful and so delicate that one is afraid it will collapse at any moment.It doesn't. The metallic, green, and watery aromas of emerging plant life are grounded by the earthier, velvety notes of soil and violet petals. The end result is a perfume that manages to suggest new life while remaining ever so slightly wistful and melancholic in tone. In the base, the ethereal florals are wreathed in smoke, incense, and earth, a reminder of our own eventual return to the ground.Serge Lutens' exclusive Palais Royal line is now available in a travel atomizer set that includes a metal case, two 30ml refills (for a total of 60ml of juice), and a funnel. What We Think A wonderfully fresh, bright, green floral- you can practically smell the dew on the chrysanthemum blooms."," Chrysanthemum, violets, green notes, earthy notes, ash, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36159.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Molecule 04 Eau de Toilette,1666,Escentric Molecules," Following on in the Escentric Molecules' tradition of focusing on one or more modern synthetics for the“meat” of a fragrance,  Molecule 04 focuses entirely on Javanol,  a powerful Givaudan sandalwood synthetic that replaces natural sandalwood oil. In the hands of anyone else other than Geza Schoen,  this could have been a disaster – Javanol is so potent that even a touch too much is,  well,  too much. But this is a triumph. Schoen has deployed his natural deftness of touch to ensure that the rosy,  creamy,  and steamy,  tropical facets of Javanol are brought forward,  and all its heaviness is left behind. It feels light,  almost fresh,  with a green“stripped bark” note that brings in an element of the great outdoors. ""What I love about Javanol is its almost psychedelic freshness, ” says Geza Schoen. ""It smells as if liquid metal grapefruit peel were poured over a bed of velvety cream colored roses."" We agree,  adding only that this is a fragrance whose subtle power and radiance can be best perceived in the sillage rather than directly on the skin,  giving you your own personal invisible cloak of gorgeousness.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30850.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escentric 04 Eau de Toilette,2081,Escentric Molecules," Escentric 04 is very Geza Schoen. If you're familiar with this perfumer's work from Escentric Molecule and Anat Fritz to The Beautiful Mind series, then you'll know we mean this as a compliment. Escentric 04 contains Schoen's signature of turning heavy materials like woods into gauzy, air bound creations with the thoughtful use of modern synthetics like Iso E Super and Ambroxan. Unlike other perfumers who use these materials simply to boost radiance or projection, Schoen uses them as the main building blocks for entire perfumes – and Escentric 04 is evidence, once again, that he is brilliant at it. For Escentric 04, Schoen has chosen to focus on synthetic sandalwood. Javanol is a powerfully radiant synthetic sandalwood, as is Polysantol, which is sweeter and creamier. Use too much of either and the scent can become loud and vulgar. But here, Schoen has woven a fizzing pink combo of grapefruit, rose, and pink pepper into the sandalwood, resulting in a light, creamy shimmer of woods that never overpowers. Hedione and ambroxan add a fresh, salty“whiteness” that illuminates the woods from within. Nothing overdosed or harsh, just a perfect balance between sparkling fruit, roses, salt, flowers, creamy woods, and the spanking freshness of wet laundry. The ultimate summer“my skin but better” scent for both men and women.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30851.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sorong Eau de Parfum,2682,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Inspired by the smooth, contemplative smoke of olibanum incense and the bright, luminous smoke of Indonesian kyara wood oud chips, Sorong is a grand vision of a mystical plane where the spiritual and supernatural collide. Centered around the ""animalized smoke"" accord created by this awe-inspiring combination- woody and spicy, with deep tones of amber- Sorong leads off with an energizing burst of citrus, spice, and blackcurrant, immediately elevating the fragrance with an airy yet substantial jolt of sophisticated energy and setting the stage for the vividly smoky, yet ultra-refined heart notes. Together, the potency of these materials is undeniable, and yet the effect is soothing, lending the wearer an aura of deep calm and protection. As it dries, a smouldering sexiness reasserts itself in the form of ambered musks which coax the animalism from the oud and incense with undeniable power. Like kyara itself, Sorong is a rare treasure, and a fragrance to savor."," Citrus, saffron, blackcurrant, kyara, olibanum, amber, animalic musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34555.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chronic Eau de Parfum,1317,19-69," ""In 1996, California became the first state in the US to legalize medical cannabis. But scratch the surface and there has always been a long history of cannabis cultivators and enthusiasts dedicating their lives to refining the herb. Chronic is a term for Cannabis and also alludes to 'The Chronic' - the debut album of Dr Dre. The Chronic was released in 1992, the same year as the Los Angeles riots."" -Johan BergerlinEye-openingly fresh, soothingly green, numbingly sticky- Chronic is everything a Cali weed scent should be. But rather than a straightforward reproduction of a bag of trees- after all, we can already get that out here- Chronic is a delightfully artistic reconstruction of the experience- from the sharply bitter citrus of the opening, to the dank green herbaceousness of clary sage, to a smokey twinge of vetiver. There's a naturalistic cannabis note in here too, but it emerges towards the end, bringing each note that preceded it together in a grand bouquet of, well, dankness. Take it from us- Chronic is the real stuff."," Petitgrain, bitter orange, bitter grapefruit, Russian clary sage, Virginian cedarwood, cannabis accord, amber, patchouli, vetiver, cashmere wood, moss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Capri Eau de Parfum,2869,19-69," ""I have always been captivated by legendary, trendsetting films. The movie Le MÃ©pris from 1963 featuring Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance is both iconic and stylish. The fragrance of Capri reflects the ambience of the movie. There are elements of wild citrus trees, orange blossoms, green olive groves, blue skies and the endless ocean that encircles the island."" -Johan BergelinInspired by the settings of Villa Malaparte and the iconic Godard film Le MÃ©pris, Capri is an eye-poppingly colorful journey. From the very first spray, Capri explodes with enchantingly bright aromas of blossoming orange trees, mandarin leaves and elements of the blue skies and endless ocean that encircle the island. Edgy but fresh, light but comforting, it's a stunning tribute to the rugged yet luxurious paradise on the Tyrrhenian Sea."," Mandora, Bitter Orange, Sweet Orange, Chamomile, Cardamom, Pink Pepper, Sichuan Pepper, Juniper Berries, Mandarine Oil, Mandarine Leaves Oil, Grapefruit, Galbanum, Jasmine, Osmanthus, Ylang Ylang, Orris, Ambroxan, Angelica Seeds, White Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chinese Tobacco Eau de Parfum,1768,19-69,"“There are elements of different legendary movies like Indochine in the fragrance Chinese Tobacco. A reflection of East meets West taking place in the 30's to 50's colonial French Indochina. I'm often captured by these strong contrasts and different ambiances when travelling in Asia. The old and the new. A major influence for the scent was the powerful scene in the movie ”Apocalypse Now” featuring Aurore Clement and Martin Sheen smoking opium.” -Johan BergelinExotic, hypnotic, and more than a little dangerous, Chinese Tobacco is not your typically buttoned-up European tobacco scent. Fiery red pepper and coriander ignite the senses, while incense and oud add unexpected subtlety and a gently narcotic haze. Spicy and woodsy, primal and modern, Chinese Tobacco is a gripping study of East meets West."," Bergamot, Tobacco, Red Pepper, Lemon, Ginger, Coriander, Incense, Cedarwood, Vanilla, Tar, Oud, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kasbah Eau de Parfum,1262,19-69,"“Stories of how personalities like Talitha and Paul Getty, Paul Bowles, Mick Jagger, Veruschka and Yves Saint Laurent all resided in Marrakech during the 60s and 70s have always inspired me. I'm intrigued by how they used this place for influences and escapes of all kinds: clothes, colours, music, interior and drugs. So, the fragrance of Kasbah is an appreciation to the international party scene during this era. ” -Johan BergelinWoody, welcoming, drenched in the soothing orange tones of a desert sunset, Kasbah is a hazy journey to the outer reaches of culture and consciousness. Opening with a sweet, zesty burst of citrus and honey, the shifting sands soon uncover dusty, warm geranium and delicately spiced amber. As the sun sets, casting an ever-more-auburn glow over clay walls, we smell the smooth, soothing combination of leather, tonka, and soft woods. It's a trip- in more ways than one."," Sweet Orange, Lime, White Honey, Geranium, Amber, Patchouli, Vanilla, Tonka Beans, Guaiac Wood, Leather Accord, Sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rainbow Bar Eau de Parfum,1223,19-69," ""The notorious Rainbow Bar on Sunset Strip was founded when the word ""rainbow"" signified peace and freedom. Think Pamela Courson, sex, drugs and rockÂ´nÂ´roll. But there are also the other lighter dimensions like the sun, the blue skies and warm glow that embrace LA. As the lyrics in the famous song by America go: 'Driving on Ventura Highway, the free wind blowing through your hair.' It's all been captured in the fragrance Rainbow Bar.” -Johan BergelinLos Angeles during the glam rock era, in a wickedly smooth and spicy fragrance cocktail: that's the good-to-the-last-drop appeal of Rainbow Bar. A brightly bitter, herbaceous first taste of davana and wormwood goes down like a shot of Jager, while soothingly spicy cardamom, nutmeg, clove, and cypress keep the high alive. The woodsy base is rich, but soft, letting the spices sing all night long. With all the purring, shimmying sex appeal of feathered hair, eyeliner, and a leather jumpsuit, Rainbow Bar's got what it takes to keep the party rocking through last call."," Davana, Bergamot, Cypress, Wormwood, Cardamom, Marine accord, Basil, Elemi, Artemisia, Grape Seed, Bourbon, Nutmeg, Vetyver, Clove, Guaiac Wood, Cedarwood, Pimento Seeds",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'air Barbes Eau de Parfum,2293,19-69," ""I was in my teens when I first discovered Helmut NewtonÂ´s picture that made YSLÂ´s Le Smoking iconic. The genderlessness really made a big impression on me. With stark monochrome simplicity, Newton created a piece of iconography I still find myself influenced by. In the making of LÂ´air BarbÃ¨s I was strongly influenced by the androgyny in this picture."" -Johan BergelinCold and fresh, L'Air Barbes is a tribute to Paris, capital de la mode. Evocative of Paris' different personas such as the concrete alleyways, le banlieue and the area BarbÃ¨s-Rochechouart, the fragrance sings of chilled aldehydes, wet stone, and smooth, rich orris. Modern, yet timeless, just like the City of Lights itself."," Aldehydes, Fresh Lemon, Bergamot, Concrete, Ylang Ylang, Tuberose, Ambroxan, Orris, Cumin Seeds, Ink, Leather, Dry Woods, White Musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gris Clair Eau de Parfum,1170,Serge Lutens," Gris Clair, Lutens's ode to lavender, evokes in our minds the image of a cool flame...a strange, otherworldly flame that illuminates but doesn't warm and doesn't burn if you touch it. The wonderfully refined, complex and beautifully ethereal creation beings with a chilly, shimmery, definitely“gray” lavender note. The contrast of the cold lavender and the sweeter, warmer blend of amber and tonka bean in the middle stage is incredibly appealing. Our favorite part of Gris Clair are the elegantly charred, smoky base notes of dry wood and“burned incense”. The darker accord gives Gris Clair an infinite depth and the exotic, opulent feel that we came to associate with the best Lutens's creations. The chilly lavender, the honeyed amber, the gently smoldering ashes of precious woods and incense create a unique, harmonious and striking, fusion of darkness and luminosity. Absolutely exquisite."," lavender, amber, tonka bean, iris, dry wood, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36119.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fleurs de Citronnier Eau de Parfum,1436,Serge Lutens," The effect of beautiful simplicity is perhaps the hardest to achieve in perfume. Make it too straightforward and the scent becomes boring, complicate the composition, and the delicate beauty of the star notes becomes obscured. With Fleurs de Citronnier, Serge Lutens shows us how it's done, presenting the fragrance of classical simplicity, a harmonious, uncluttered blend which allows the radiant beauty of the ingredients to shine. Lemon blossom, neroli and tuberose form a delightfully pure and fresh accord, evocative of a breezy summer day...a romantic stroll in a Mediterranean garden, under the blossoming lemon and orange trees...A subtle musk note in the base grounds and rounds the scent, adding a sensual touch to the beautifully ethereal flowers. Treat yourself to a bottle of this breathtaking aroma and let it be forever summer."," Lemon blossom, neroli, tuberose, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Homme Aux Gants Eau de Parfum,2498,Parfums MDCI," A masterpiece of Italian Renaissance portraiture, Titien's Man With A Glove is renowned for the complexity of its subject, whose facial expression and hand placement suggest preoccupations far beyond the triviality of the idle rich. How appropriate, then, that L'Homme Aux Gants turns out to be a fragrance with a commensurate depth beneath the surface- a nuanced, sophisticated blend of oudh, spice, and woods designed for a gentleman who knows he's defined by more than the clothes he wears. L'Homme Aux Gants arrives on a wave of sweet, gently energetic Indonesian nutmeg, building into a warm, rugged heart of earthy cypriol and sensual hedione. But it's in the quietly powerful base that L'Homme Aux Gants truly comes to life, blending a soft, smooth oudh note with a rich melange of resins, woods, patchouli, and vanilla, creating a soothing yet complex aura that lingers for hours. Like the masterpiece that bears its name, L'Homme Aux Gants reserves its most treasured secrets for those with the sophistication to appreciate them."," Nutmeg, cypriol, hedione, oud, cedar, patchouli, gaiac, gurjum, tonka bean, benzoin, vanilla, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36522.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bleu Satin Eau de Parfum,2138,Parfums MDCI," Inspired by Thomas Gainsborough's famous The Blue Boy, Bleu Satin is a bright, fresh, exuberantly fruit-forward celebration of a scent, sure to appeal to lovers of fruity masculine scents everywhere. Impossibly juicy bergamot and electric green notes open the scent in full swing, while a deliciously fruity heart really separates Bleu Satin from its cohort, with sweet, intoxicating cassis and mouthwatering watermelon set against a hypnotically lush jasmine- fresh and elegant in equal measure. Finally, a base of gently-spiced leather lends longevity without sacrificing the vibrant spirit of the scent. Sophisticated and youthful, colorful and fresh, Bleu Satin is a new high-water mark for the fruity masculine, and we can't get enough."," Bergamot, lemon, green notes, jasmine, cassis, watermelon, saffron, leather, woody notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36523.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir Cavalier Eau de Parfum,1826,Parfums MDCI," Gericault's Charging Chasseur, his first exhibited work, already demonstrated the artist's impressive talent for subverting the tropes of convention (in this case the heroic portrait of a Napoleonic cavalryman) in the service of creating a more complex, challenging narrative. It's the perfect inspiration for Cuir Cavalier, a richly spiced oud and leather scent that nods to the heavyweights of the smoky leather category while carving out a smooth, sophisticated niche all its own. Cuir Cavalier opens bright and fiery, with a crisp Italian red tangerine paired with a luscious saffron, leading into a rich floral leather heart. A warm, powerful base of oud and vanilla hums beautifully, a perfect chord with the still potent thread of saffron that continues to elevate the entire composition with a poised masculine gracefulness. Like a masterpiece that presents an iconic image in a way you've never before seen, Cuir Cavalier is a bold new portrait of a classic concept."," Italian red tangerine, saffron, rose, iris, cypriol, white honey, oud, soft leather, cedar, tonka bean, vanilla, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36524.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chameleon Eau de Parfum,2768,Zoologist," Like the luminescent skin of a reptile, fiery scales of sunlight ripple across the surface of the Indian Ocean, fading slowly to gold and finally sapphire as the sun sinks and disappears. The sea exhales, its gentle tide caressing the beach of an island paradise. The salty breath combines with the narcotic aromas of the ylang and frangipani trees in an intimate kiss, sending shivers through the branches. Something stirs – an eye pivots, a tail grips a slender bough. Will the creature vanish among the leaves, or flirt with a daring display of colour? No one knows. The secrets that lie beneath the skin of the chameleon keep Madagascar guessing. What we do know, however, is that Zoologist Chameleon is a deliciously elusive blend of bright florals, hypnotic musks, and exotic fruit that can turn the wearer into anything they want to be. Madagascar, home to half of the world's species of chameleons, holds the key to Zoologist Chameleon. Like the kaleidoscope of hues that swirl within the flesh of these exotic creatures, ylang dances with delicate frangipani upon your skin in a melody of creamy florals, while aphrodisiac vanilla blends with salty, silky musks to envelop you in the fruity, exotic atmosphere of the island. Whether you desire to shroud yourself in an air of mystery, or blatantly flaunt your true colours, Chameleon becomes you."," Bergamot, Lemon, Madagascar Ylang Ylang, Mango, Pink Pepper, Star Fruit, Violet Leaves, Cashmeran, Clove, Coconut, Frangipani, Jasmine, Saffron, Salty Skin Accord, Sea Breeze, Amber, Woods, Musks, Opoponax, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dodo Eau de Parfum,2826,Zoologist," The sun sparkled across rippling waves, its morning dance upon the Indian Ocean rousing the dodos from their carefree slumber. Stumbling drunkenly from their nests, the birds waddled through the sea of luscious ferns that carpeted the forest floor, to feast on fat, ripe berries. For generations, the island paradise of Mauritius nurtured the dodos, its predator-free and bountiful shores lulling them into a state of such complacency that even their wings grew idle, and flight was lost – even to memory. Ultimately their evolution would betray them cruelly, but while it lasted, the dodos enjoyed an existence marked by ease and comfort. It's only appropriate, therefore, that Zoologist Dodo is as laid-back a fougere as you'll ever encounter- an ultra-fresh, green, delightfully whimsical blend of fruit, flower and moss that may just lull you into a sublime state of relaxation. Dodo opens with an invigorating burst of tart lime and juicy berries, inviting you to venture deep into a forest dense with vibrant ferns. Delicate fiddleheads unfurl to reveal tendrils of feathery musk, as rosy florals float up to embrace them. Dodo is a paradox. Like those extinct inhabitants of Mauritius, the scent is at once classic and iconic, yet eerily unknowable and endlessly fascinating. The ideal fougere for those with an eclectic sensibility, who crave a life of leisure and contentment."," Fern, Lime, Lychee, Raspberry, Ambergris, Fir Balsam, Geranium, Rose, Amber, Feathery Musk, Oakmoss, Patchouli, Sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76024.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Santal Blanc Eau de Parfum,1926,Serge Lutens," As with most perfumes in the Serge Lutens line, the name of the fragrance never gives you the full story. Santal Blanc means white sandalwood, but this is not light, airy sandalwood and its personality is far deeper than you might expect.  Built on a beautiful contrast of softness and piquancy, the fragrance opens with bursts of tangy pink pepper and fresh cedar notes, while its evolution brings out a creamy white sandalwood and beautifully unexpected twists of bitter cinnamon and fenugreek. Orris root (you'll recognize it as the scent of violets) rose and jasmine are background players, happy to let the woods, spices and musk mingle. Perfectly at ease on a man or woman, Santal Blanc is enigmatic and memorable, possessing enough mystery to keep you on your toes and wondering where its next evolution will take you-- forever changing, forever mysterious, forever enchanting."," White sandalwood, fenugreek, pink pepper, cinnamon, rose, jasmine, orris root, musk, benzoin, copaiba balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36116.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
City Of Jasmine Extrait de Parfum,1316,Alghabra Parfums," Summer in Damascus, when the jasmine blooms from every corner of the city. Well-dressed men stop to beat the afternoon heat with cool fresh fruits, or perhaps an icy drink of lemonade near a courtyard fountain. This is the portrait of City Of Jasmine, a delightfully refreshing masculine scent that takes the beloved and renowned structure of the fruit-forward men's scent to a newly exotic destination.The first notes of City Of Jasmine should be familiar to those on board with the fruity-masculine trend- a juicy, gently tart apple set against a musky leather for a wonderfully crisp and modern opening. But City Of Jasmine separates itself from the pack with a luscious floral heart, the complex, delicately indolic jasmine smoothed with a touch of rose for a seductive element of floral sophistication head and shoulders above the imitators. In the long-lasting base, a perfect touch of musk and vanilla provides contrast against the still-fresh leather note and adds the perfect final phase to an unforgettable, everyday-perfect scent. There are many fruity masculine fragrances, but there is undeniably only one City Of Jasmine."," Apple, leather, jasmine, rose, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Scent Of Paradise Extrait de Parfum,2904,Alghabra Parfums," The pure essence of springtime in Damascus, Scent Of Paradise is an unforgettable unisex citrus floral for free spirits and dreamers of all kinds. A blindingly fresh burst of bergamot-led citrus dazzles the senses, building into a perfectly blended, gently sweet floral heart that deftly balances lavender, rose, and iris against the still-present citrus for an unforgettable yet oh-so-easy-to-wear combination that lingers for hours, while a gentle base of ambery sandalwood soothes and relaxes without ever feeling overly warm or heavy. Enticing, romantic, sophisticated and outright fun, Scent Of Paradise is truly a citrus lover's dream: spray it on, close your eyes, and allow yourself to be carried away."," Bergamot, fruity notes, iris, rose, lavender, amber, musk, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
From The Heart Extrait de Parfum,2065,Alghabra Parfums," Inspired by the lush beauty of the traditional Arab-Islamic courtyard house and the many fruits and flowers that flourished there in the days of Old Damascus, From The Heart is a thoroughly lovely and joyful scent. Like the traditional bitter orange trees that spread their distinctively fresh aroma through the courtyard, From The Heart opens bright and citrussy, with a lusciously sweet fruitiness from peach and ylang. At the core of the scent, a fully blooming flower garden exudes lush romanticism from the exquisite damask rose, as well as the full-bodied, sensual freshness of lily, all warmed by a subtle ambered base. Like the warm summer air wafting through the stately courtyard, From The Heart is an exuberant expression of freshness that lingers in the memory."," Bergamot, bitter orange, damask rose, lily, peach, ylang ylang, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
King Of Flowers Extrait de Parfum,2844,Alghabra Parfums," In the Old City of Damascus, the narrow streets and ancient alleyways carry a dizzying, magical array of scents: fresh flowers from the marketplace, mouthwatering treats emerging hot from bakery ovens, exotic spices from bubbling pots in local kitchens. Taken together, these are the smells of a timeless community, and their indelible memory is the essence of King Of Flowers, a richly evocative extrait from Alghabra. Opening fresh, green, and citrussy, the composition soon deepens as the titular white flowers, warm and sensual, blossom in the heart of the fragrance against a smooth, creamy vanilla. A sophisticated touch of ambered leather makes us pause to think of the many travelers that have ventured these ancient streets- perhaps they, too, stopped to marvel at the wondrous combination of aromas on the warm summer breeze. If so, King Of Flowers would surely transport them back just as it does for us. A magical, whimsical, unforgettable scent."," Bergamot, grapefruit, amber, vanilla, white flowers, lavender, sandalwood, leather, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Poem Of Damas Extrait de Parfum,2898,Alghabra Parfums," If the notes list for Poem Of Damas seems a little vague, don't fret: you'll know exactly what you're smelling when you experience it, which is to say that Poem of Damas is one of the most straightforwardly confident, lush, downright gorgeous rose-oud scents we've ever encountered. Featuring an exquisite floral bouquet supplemented with the finest agarwood extract available on the market, Poem Of Damas seems to forego the traditional fragrance structure: the rich, dark, smooth oud explodes off the skin from the first spray, soon met with a lusciously rich Damascene rose, warm, romantic and completely captivating. Gently ambered tones of fruit and spice wax and wane throughout the life of the scent, sanding every rough edge and deepening the intense sophistication of the composition, which manages to feel hypnotically seductive and warmly comforting all at once, with a glow that lingers for untold hours. Simply put? This is rose oud as it was meant to be experienced."," Rose, floral notes, fruity notes, amber, oud, oriental notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Boha Parfum Extrait,1930,Jeroboam," The power of a white flower, pristine and perfect, imposing in its unadorned beauty. This is the inspiration of Boha, an intensely lovely gardenia-led white floral that radiates sublimity and yet surrounds the wearer in provocation. Like staring into the sun, we open with the blinding freshness of electrically bright bergamot and bitingly green almond. As we adjust to the light, we bask in the sheer beauty of gardenia, romantic and opulent, blended perfectly with sweet orange blossom and lush jasmine. As with all Jeroboam scents, the base is built around their richly sensual Enigmatic Musks, along with warm amber and smooth, creamy Australian sandalwood for an unforgettably seductive base. White floral lovers, this one's emphatically for you."," Bergamot, green almond, violet leaves, gardenia, Egyptian jasmine, orange blossom, ambery woods, enigmatic musks, oakmoss, Australian sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71409.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Patiala Extrait,1876,Thameen," Created by Cartier in 1928 for an Indian Maharaja, the Patiala Necklace is an impossibly opulent piece of jewelry at the center of an unsolved mystery.  Containing 2,390 diamonds, the necklace disappeared in 1948, only to have bits and pieces reappear at various auctions over the years without explanation. To this day, the disappearance has never been explained. In this spirit of opulence and mystery, Thameen presents Patiala, a shimmering and sophisticated sweet floral too precious to misplace. Patiala opens with a head-spinning rush of energizing citrus and blinding aldehydes, sparkling with the intensity of its namesake's centerpiece 235 carat diamond. Yet it wears as comfortably as the necklace might around one who could afford it, with a rich, lush heart of orange flower and rose that anoints the bearer as royalty. A sweet, musky amber glows for countless hours, bathing us in serene reflected light. The original Patiala Necklace has sadly been lost to mystery, never to be experienced in its original glory again. But with this Patiala, we have a pretty good sense of just how it must have felt to experience such luxurious beauty."," Citrus, aldehyde, orange flower, rose, moss, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escentric 02 - Travel Spray Eau de Toilette,1885,Escentric Molecules," While its sister scent Molecule 02 is built around the single note of ambroxan (the manmade equivalent of costly natural ambergris), Escentric 02 blends the note with vetiver and the cruelty-free musk imposter muscone. Add just a touch of orris, elderflower extract and the sunny, jasmine-like feel of hedione and it's light, refreshing and yes, even brisk fragrance that sparkles and enchants from beginning to end.  It's the kind of brisk you think of when smelling a freshly poured gin and tonic over lots and lots of ice, only Escentric has a fascinating mineral-like finish that amps things up to super spectacular. It's a wear  anytime, go anywhere type of scent with a very relaxed, unassuming nature...utterly at ease, totally uncomplicated and easy going, we find ourselves reaching for it over and over when everything else just seems not quite right that day. Escentric 02 fits the bill every time.Please note: Both 30ml versions come with the same style atomizer bottle. The 'Alloy case' version is packaged in a lightweight brushed metal case, the 'refill' version is packaged in a traditional paper box."," Ambroxan, vetiver, muscone, orris, elderflower",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30815.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Molecule 04 - Travel Spray Eau de Toilette,1579,Escentric Molecules," Following on in the Escentric Molecules' tradition of focusing on one or more modern synthetics for the“meat” of a fragrance,  Molecule 04 focuses entirely on Javanol,  a powerful Givaudan sandalwood synthetic that replaces natural sandalwood oil. In the hands of anyone else other than Geza Schoen,  this could have been a disaster – Javanol is so potent that even a touch too much is,  well,  too much. But this is a triumph. Schoen has deployed his natural deftness of touch to ensure that the rosy,  creamy,  and steamy,  tropical facets of Javanol are brought forward,  and all its heaviness is left behind. It feels light,  almost fresh,  with a green“stripped bark” note that brings in an element of the great outdoors. ""What I love about Javanol is its almost psychedelic freshness, ” says Geza Schoen. ""It smells as if liquid metal grapefruit peel were poured over a bed of velvety cream colored roses."" We agree,  adding only that this is a fragrance whose subtle power and radiance can be best perceived in the sillage rather than directly on the skin,  giving you your own personal invisible cloak of gorgeousness.Please note: Both 30ml versions come with the same style atomizer bottle. The 'Alloy case' version is packaged in a lightweight brushed metal case,  the 'refill' version is packaged in a traditional paper box.", Javanol,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30852.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Escentric 04 - Travel Spray Eau de Toilette,1188,Escentric Molecules," Escentric 04 is very Geza Schoen. If you're familiar with this perfumer's work from Escentric Molecule and Anat Fritz to biehl parfumkunstwerke, then you'll know we mean this as a compliment. Escentric 04 contains Schoen's signature of turning heavy materials like woods into gauzy, air bound creations with the thoughtful use of modern synthetics like Iso E Super and Ambroxan. Unlike other perfumers who use these materials simply to boost radiance or projection, Schoen uses them as the main building blocks for entire perfumes – and Escentric 04 is evidence, once again, that he is brilliant at it. For Escentric 04, Schoen has chosen to focus on synthetic sandalwood. Javanol is a powerfully radiant synthetic sandalwood, as is Polysantol, which is sweeter and creamier. Use too much of either and the scent can become loud and vulgar. But here, Schoen has woven a fizzing pink combo of grapefruit, rose, and pink pepper into the sandalwood, resulting in a light, creamy shimmer of woods that never overpowers. Hedione and ambroxan add a fresh, salty“whiteness” that illuminates the woods from within. Nothing overdosed or harsh, just a perfect balance between sparkling fruit, roses, salt, flowers, creamy woods, and the spanking freshness of wet laundry. The ultimate summer“my skin but better” scent for both men and women.Please note: Both 30ml versions come with the same style atomizer bottle. The 'Alloy case' version is packaged in a lightweight brushed metal case, the 'refill' version is packaged in a traditional paper box."," Pink Grapefruit, Bergamot, Juniper Berry, Pink Pepper, Hedione, Freesia, Osmanthus, Orris, Rose, Javanol, Mastic, Labdanum, Iso E Super, Musk, Ambroxan, Castoreum, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30853.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
XJ Amber Gold & Rose Gold Collection Eau de Parfum,1305,Xerjoff," After the overwhelming reception for the exquisite Amber & Musk Collection (Star Musk and Amber Star), Xerjoff introduces another dynamic duo of unique fragrances that let you decide how you'd like to wear them, presented in a lavish and exclusive collector's set. Amber Gold is a luscious, vibrant delight that reflects the dazzling glow of amber with a sparkling cascade of juicy citrus and spicy florals. A sublime orange blossom lends sweet, romantic depth as an ever-warming base of musky amber develops into a luminous richness. Rose Gold weds the deep exotic lushness of Bulgarian rose with an energetic heart of geranium, balancing sophistication with playful nimbleness. A compellingly woodsy base of patchouli and musk further deepens our seduction.Worn together, florals, fruits and ambers weave into a complex and sensually compelling symphony, powerful and beautiful in equal measure, uniquely balanced each time you wear it."," Amber Gold: Tangerine, coriander, orange flower, tobacco flower, almond blossom, patchouli, musk, amberRose Gold: Bulgarian rose, Egyptian geranium, Indonesian patchouli, amber, musk, buddah wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/511051.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Aura Perfume Oil,2081,Essential Faith," The cult classic success of the original Essential Faith was undeniable evidence that there's nothing sexier than individuality- after all, the barely-there blend of exquisitely soft, musky oils was less of a perfume in any traditional sense and more a supercharged enhancement of your natural essence, blending seamlessly with each wearer to smell distinctively different on anyone. With Aura, the intoxicating original Essential Faith formula returns with an appropriately subtle supplement, a perfectly portioned dollop of exquisite vanilla, which adds a warming, seductive twist to the sublime freshness of the original. Creamy, cozy, not overly sweet, this is vanilla that glows with ambered tones, drawing people in for an unforgettable closer sniff. A divinely delicious second skin, Aura may not be for those who like their fragrances loud- but for those who value being true to themselves above all, it's downright essential.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Allende Parfum,1760,Xerjoff," Allende is a gift fallen from the sky. A rare perfume, like the meteorite for which this powerful creation draws its name. A sophisticated magnolia-based harmony reverberates in the heart notes, whilst an intoxicating slipstream of Madagascar vanilla drapes the entire blend. Notes of cream, spice, florals and soft earth swirl majestically, making the mouth water and the pulse soar. Mysterious and magical, delicious and deceptively deep, Allende is a more-than-a-gourmand vanilla with sensuality to spare."," Vanilla Madagascar, magnolia, cocoa",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51150.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Aoud Exclusif Eau de Parfum,1347,Mancera," Ferociously spicy, exotically romantic, Aoud Exclusif is a hypnotic dance of oud, rose, and leather as only Mancera could deliver. Like the intoxicatingly dark color of the juice itself, Aoud Exclusif is mysterious and compelling, opening with fiery spices igniting atop resinous labdanum. The spice, an eye-popping blend of cumin, saffron, and black pepper, bursts though the inky richness of the lush rose and deep oud, letting a few tantalizing rays of light through to balance the seductive darkness. As the rich, refined leather base supports and enriches the warmth of the woods, we realize how completely we are under its spell, enchanted and deeply content. An oud fragrance for lovers and mystics alike, Aoud Exclusif is not to be missed."," Labdanum, spicy cumin, saffron, pepper, rose, violet, patchouli, oud, leather, vanilla, amber, white musk, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64937.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Vanilla Shot Eau de Parfum,2049,Olfactive Studio," The first of the Sepia Collection, a bold trio of Parfum Extraits from legendary perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour, Vanilla Shot is an extraordinary scent. Inspired by a photograph of a breathtaking Land Art sculpture from Martin Hill- an arch made of dry reeds suspended weightlessly above New Zealand's Wanaka Lake- Duchaufour delivers an equally gravity-defying fragrance that contrasts the deep, indulgent richness of pure vanilla with intensely fresh elements for a luminously oriental experience.  Our expectations for a vanilla scent are disposed of almost instantly, as Vanilla Shot opens with a stimulating jolt of electric spice- coriander and saffron, supplemented with an ultra-clean aldehyde sparkle. But as with Hill's photograph, balance is paramount, and before our fragrance gets carried into the clouds a rich heart of dried fruit, warm opoponax, and fresh rose tethers us again to the land, hinting of depth yet to come. Against this deeply sensual contrast, we encounter a rich base of complex, creamy vanilla and sweet, warm resins, soothing and seducing even while the fresh elements continue to reach skyward, achieving a wondrous, poetic geometry that lingers for hours. A new high water mark for Olfactive Studios, Vanilla Shot is a unique, compelling accomplishment a world away from your typical vanilla fragrance."," Coriander, saffron, aldehydes, rose, dried fruits, opoponax, vanilla, caramel, myrrh, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61515.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Kiso Eau de Parfum,2496,D.S. and Durga," Spare, serene, and deceptively deep, Amber Kiso is an enchanting new vision of an amber fragrance through the prism of feudal Japan. It's amber stripped down to its essence- an abstraction of captured light- taking a decidedly eastern alternative to the traditional labdanum-and-vanilla representation of European-style amber scents. Instead, Amber Kiso is a vision of sunlight piercing the tranquility of an ancient forest, the brightness of fresh moss against the unique strength of cedar and hinoki. A tendril of temple incense, pure and contemplative, winds itself throughout the heart of the scent, while a clean, smooth leather represents the traditional bushi armor of a samurai. Elegant and spiritual, Amber Kiso is unlike any amber we've encountered before- and we're lost in its spell."," Japanese cedar, incense, cypress, maple, patchouli, iris, hinoki, leather, treemoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68681.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Teutonic Eau de Parfum,1683,D.S. and Durga," As the companion scent to the Japanese-inspired Amber Kisu, you'd be forgiven for thinking the oh-so-European-named Amber Teutonic would be constructed in the more traditional labdanum-and-vanilla style amber form. However, we're delighted to report that Teutonic, inspired by the breathtaking old-growth forests of Austria and Germany, turns out to be every bit as creative as its counterpart, envisioning an amber alive with aromatic freshness, bursting with notes of pine, templin (fir) cone, and bright, stout cedarwood. A distinctively bright accord of cardamom and green mandarin adds to the luminous glow, while a rich base of smooth musk and sweet, balsamic opoponax provide a soothingly familiar amber warmth. Escape to a still mythic world of towering ancient trees and magical creatures- Amber Teutonic is an adventure in a bottle."," Alpine cedar, cardamom, green mandarin, geranium, European larch, templin cone, pine, opoponax, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68682.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Each Other Eau de Parfum,1360,The House Of Oud," Inspired by the wild and wonderful street art of THoO founder Andrea Casotti's native Milan, Each Other is a collaboration with famed Milanese graffiti writer KayOne that uses an electrifying contrast of bright and dark notes to represent the urban vitality of their shared hometown. The fragrance opens high in the clouds, with a blinding burst of citrus shining like a ray of light on the iconic outline of the Duomo di Milano. But there's much more to this vibrant, bustling metropolis than tourist attractions, and Each Other quickly takes to the living, breathing streets, the colorful graffiti represented in fiery spice and rich aromatics. As the sun sets and the stylish young Milanese come out to play, nightfall takes the intriguingly bitter contrast of calamus and wormwood, like a strong cocktail to start the evening. Finally, warm labdanum and luminous vetiver represent the city lit up, inviting and intimidating, alive in its contradictions. Discover the true complexity of Milan with Each Other- a dynamic fragrance for a city that deserves nothing less."," Citrus blend, grapefruit, pink pepper, coriander, calamus, wormwood, labdanum, ambergris, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76424.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1900 L'Heure de Proust Eau de Parfum,1962,Les Bains Guerbois," 1900, the height of La Belle Epoque. Legendary author Marcel Proust and a cherished confidante retire to the bains sulfureux for a day of elaborate pampering- steam, massage, and a grand tea service to while away the private hours. The delicacies enjoyed in these intimate moments make up the magical scent of 1900 L'Heure de Proust. Our service begins with the exquisite fruits used to flavour the tea, tart, bright grapefruit and lusciously juicy blueberry, set against the smoky richness of pure black tea and the refined leather upholstering the private couch to where our subjects have retired. The unisex freshness of violet perfumes the wood-panelled room, while a tray of mouthwatering desserts- sweet pralines and creamy vanilla cake- beckon our indulgence. The scent is gorgeous, delightful, masculine and feminine intertwined- far from scandalous, but equally far from innocent. Indeed, when naming a scent for Proust, the bar is raised- and we're delighted to say that 1900 L'Heure de Proust is evocative enough to inspire a masterpiece of your own."," Bergamot, blueberry, grapefruit, violet, black tea, Tuscan leather, mate, gaiac, praline, vanilla, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79708.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blanc Poudre Eau de Parfum,2031,HEELEY," Inspired by the pure whiteness of French Porcelain, Blanc Poudre is a masterful testament to the sophistication of perfect, clean simplicity. Glowing with an impossibly smooth blend of pristine cotton flower and vintage rice powder, the opening of Blanc Poudre is hypnotically soft, glowing with a luminous freshness that hides a barely perceptible sweetness beneath. As a pillowy heart of white musk floats into the picture, a masterfully deployed dollop of sandalwood and vanilla reveals the depths of this disarmingly simple, wonderfully precise blend. For those who desire a clean that goes far beyond soapy department store musks, Blanc Poudre is a pristine treasure."," Cotton flower, rice powder, white musk, vanilla, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31527.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sweet Flowers Eau de Parfum,2194,Montale," Sweet and fresh, fresh and sweet... so often in perfume, we find one at the expense of the other, resigned to the idea that what makes our mouths water and what makes our hearts flutter are mutually exclusive. And then a wonderfully romantic confection like Sweet Flowers crosses our nose, and we fall in love all over again. Vibrant and nimble with tingling spice and airy florals and, yet lusciously laced with sugared fruits and creamy vanilla, Sweet Flowers is the best of both worlds, a rare low-calorie dessert that actually delivers on its promise. Youthful yet sexy, gourmand yet guilt-free, Sweet Flowers is a pop of pure joy you'll need to smell for yourself."," Bergamot, white peach, ginger, spicy pepper, cotton candy, patchouli, jasmine, tuberose, violet, vanilla, oakmoss, grey amber, white musk, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bakhoor,2424,Montale," Born from the ancient traditions of nomadic tribes of the Middle East, a Bakhoor is a unique take on fragrant smoke- a wood chip soaked in a special recipe- different for each person- of scented oils and resins and slowly burned in a vessel known as a Mabkhara. The resulting scent- no two identical, but always rich, smoky, sweet, woodsy- is thought to purify, relax, and even treat traditional maladies. As a perfume, Bakhoor draws on the long history of this tradition, delivering a raw, exotic scent that feels equally contemplative and seductive, rich in resin, sandalwood, oud, and leather. For those who love smoky, sophisticated, sensual scents with a touch of the out-of-ordinary- don't miss Bakhoor."," Oud, saffron, tanned leather, cedarwood, vetiver, sandalwood, grey amber, white musk, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Leather Patchouli Eau de Parfum,1837,Montale," Let's get one thing clear- Leather Patchouli is not a gourmand scent. After all, it more than delivers on its titular promise, delivering a rich, robust oriental with deep tones of earthy patchouli and smooth, masculine leather. You'd be forgiven for not realizing it on first sniff, though, as Leather Patchouli combines all the complimentary notes you might expect- labdanum, oud, cedarwood- with a delectable blend of white musk, vanilla, and saffron, balancing the richness of the main ingredients with a smooth sweetness that accentuates the natural gourmand aspects of the patchouli without ever venturing into ""sugar syrup"" territory. The result is a dynamic scent, rugged enough to satisfy the most macho of tastes, but smooth enough to sport with the most elegant of evening wear."," Leather, labdanum, oud, patchouli, cedar, sandalwood, saffron, ambergris, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Musk Eau de Parfum,1384,Montale," Montale, admittedly, is not known for subtlety- their bold perfumes wear their powerful Middle Eastern influences proudly, and as a result have become beloved of those craving fragrances of beastly projection and sillage. But that doesn't mean the venerable Parisian house doesn't do subtle from time to time, and the latest example- the warm, mysterious,  Amber Musk- may be their best skin scent yet. Like a gentle caress, sweet, warm notes of amber glide tenderly above the skin, contrasting notes of clean powder against a soft, seductively musky current of animalic sensuality. It lingers on the skin for hours, leaving a trail of warm carnality in its wake, drawing those around you in ever closer. A true secret weapon if ever there was one, Amber Musk isn't like your typically beastly Montale scent- and it's all the sexier for it."," Sweet amber, powder, white musk, grey amber, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mefisto Gentiluomo Eau de Parfum,1923,Xerjoff - Casamorati," Mefisto Gentiluomo is, as the name suggests, a gentleman's cologne, composed in the style of the eaux de cologne used in upscale barbershop joints in Italy circa 1888. Like its progenitor, Mefisto, Gentiluomo takes what seems to have become a dirty word in perfumery – clean – and makes it sexy again. Think the steamy aromas in a traditional Italian barbershop after a shave – triple-milled soap, plush white towels, $500 handmade leather loafers, and the sweet creaminess of sandalwood lotion massaged into warm skin. Yes, Gentiluomo wins the day by being gorgeously, luxuriously clean without leaning on cheap musks or powder.Right off the bat, Mefisto Gentiluomo playfully updates its predecessor's model by brushing its bright, salty citrus notes with icy mint and a burst of bitter green leaves. It wows on the basis of just how natural and mouth-wateringly fresh it smells. Salty lavender lends a subtle ozonic feel – not marine or aquatic per se, but rather a hillside of leathery herbs brushed by sea air. We're impressed with the bubble of sweetness that floats up here, a slightly candied citrus or lavender note that serves to balance out the sharper notes, giving it a polished, modern vibe. But if Mefisto Gentiluomo starts out in the maquis of a Mediterranean hillside, and lingers in the luxuriantly bright, clean atmosphere of a traditional barbershop, it ultimately comes to rest in the milieu of a Florentine artisan's workshop, where the scent of suede mingles companionably with the patina of centuries-old wood. The flowers contribute only a softness of texture, but the iris stands out, bathing the aromatics in its spectral glow. Handsome, refined, and full of Italian braggadocio, Mefisto Gentiluomo is a fresh barbershop fougere with a hidden creamy floral-citrus core that pulls it out of 1888 and right into 2018."," bergamot, lavender, lemon, grapefruit, iris, rose, violet, amber, cedar wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67414.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Uden Overdose Parfum,1504,Xerjoff," Who says perfection can't be improved upon? Though the name Uden Overdose implies that this scent is simply a stronger version of the original Uden, this scent has a distinct personality of its own and deserves to be taken on its own terms. How does it differ, you ask? Well, while Uden Overdose retains the wonderfully aromatic brightness of the original – the essence of its ”˜fougere' character - it swaps out the gourmand creaminess of Uden's booze, vanilla, and lavender for the dry toastiness of spice, hay, and woody ambers. Both are utterly charming in their different ways. But if original Uden is a fougere you feel tempted to eat, Uden Overdose is a fougere you want to roll around in, like you would in piles of new mown hay.  Uden Overdose opens similarly to Uden, burning comet bright with the aromatic sharpness of bergamot and lemon. But while original Uden turns creamy with vanilla, Uden Overdose steers immediately into a dry, spicy track, a blaze of ginger root giving the citrus a thrillingly hot and dirty underbite. Think a tannic Earl Grey tea liberally spiked with grated ginger. It smells masculine, clean, and above all, dry, with nary a hint of sugar or cream around the edges. Tobacco blossom plays a central role in Uden Overdose, its green hay-like tones giving the gingery citrus tea a rustic edge reminiscent of herbs and wildflowers baking under a hot sun. Woody ambers and musks are applied with judicious restraint in the base, thickening and sweetening the scent but never disturbing the smooth, aromatic flow of the scent's trajectory. This one's such a pleasure to wear. If you love fougeres (and the original Uden) but want a woodsy, spicy take that gives you plenty of options, then Uden Overdose is your man."," Bergamot, lemon, ginger, tobacco blossom, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51151.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Colognise Extrait de Cologne,2258,Nishane," In Turkey, houseguests are often greeted with a splash of bright, fresh lemon cologne on the hands, a traditional gesture of hospitality that both disinfects and leaves a vibrant, if short-lived scent. With Colognise, Nishane, a house well-known for rich, long-lasting extraits, takes this beloved custom and modernizes it into a dynamic, sexy, wonderfully easy-to-wear ""extrait de cologne""- a concentration that captures all of the vibrance and exuberance of a traditional citrus cologne, in a much longer-lasting 18% concentration. On first spray, Colognise positively explodes with bright, fresh lemon and bergamot, a fitting tribute to the simple, beautiful lemon colognes of its inspiration- but even in the opening, a smooth, beautiful green tea note hints at the greater complexity that lies ahead. Soon, an rich, emerging floral heart of lily and jasmine adds dimensionality and lush, unisex character, even as the citrus continues to sparkle. A sweet, grassy vetiver and soft musk further enrich the depth and romanticism, feeling modern and classic all at once. Created in the spirit of hospitality, Colognise is so very effortless to wear that you'll have to decide whether to share it with everyone- or keep it all for yourself."," Bergamot, lemon, green tea, jasmine, grapefruit, muguet, vetiver, neroli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77451.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Savile Eau de Parfum,2865,Keiko Mecheri," A dedication to masculine elegance, Savile deftly interprets the mythical fougere in chiaroscuro, reflecting the timeless chic-style and sophistication of bohemian artists haunting London's Mayfair during the 1960s. Fresh aromatic top notes of Provence lavender evolve into a rounder and more voluptuous scent enveloped in suede and woodsy-amber. Unforgettably alluring."," Citrus notes, Lavandin of Luberon, orris, jasmine sambac, suede, Virginian tobacco, cedar wood, patchouli, amber, vanilla.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/16469.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mulholland Eau de Parfum,1346,Keiko Mecheri," A citrus-drenched ode to the summer of love in Laurel Canyon. - Imagine bare feet, jangling bracelets and an acoustic guitar strumming in the background. This is a big, bright citrus, bathed in hazy California sunshine. Smooth sandalwood and rich amber provide a warm, sensuous, golden base, and a hint of patchouli gives it all a little something extra – because it wouldn't be canyon living without a little patchouli in the mix, would it?  The powerful base notes match the brightness of the citrus, resulting in an exceptionally attractive and well-balanced scent that captures California dreamin' perfectly."," Citrus, petit grain, hint of patchouli, sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/16461.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Isles Lointaines Eau de Parfum,2478,Keiko Mecheri," Picture yourself on a tropical island in the South Seas, so small it has no name, no corporate entities and no cell phone reception – just gorgeous beaches, turquoise skies and a profusion of white flowers in full bloom. All you have to do is lie on the sparkling sand, listen to the waves and dream the day away.  It might be awhile before we can afford that private South Sea island, but Isles Lointaines is the next best thing. This brazenly flirtatious potion features an incredibly lush gardenia double-whammy by blending traditional gardenia with tiare, also known as Tahitian gardenia, and the result is every bit as seductive and gorgeous as you would expect. Heady tuberose and radiant jasmine are also in the intoxicating white floral mix, and a simmering blend of sweet almond, creamy vanilla and ambery benzoin add the sultry warmth of a hot island night. This is a true glamour girl scent – suitable for sirens and mermaids, as well as mere mortals."," Sweet almond, gardenia, Tahitian tiare, tuberose, jasmine, rose absolute, vanilla, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/16458.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Datura Blanche Eau de Parfum,2080,Keiko Mecheri," Opening with an airy, lemon-like freshness, Datura Blanche announces from the beginning that is going to focus on the delicate beauty of the datura flower – ethereal and alluring with a hint of spice. A watercolor wash of tuberose and heliotrope heighten the dreamy sweetness, while a dark splash of bitter almond draws out the intriguing, narcotic aspects that make datura so notoriously provocative. In this elegant composition, the dark side whispers seductively, but never overpowers the gossamer beauty of the white flowers. A luxurious bed of tonka and vanilla adds opulence and warmth.  This has the luminous beauty of a moonlit garden – the white blooms glowing amid the velvety shadows."," white datura, Indian tuberose, heliotrope, bitter almond, tonka bean, vanilla madagascar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/16430.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Irisistible Eau de Parfum,1885,April Aromatics," How do you describe a scent when its own name says it all? Irisistible, by far April Aromatics' most ambitious scent yet, is a powerhouse of floral beauty, a showcase for a divine collection of rare and expensive natural materials sure to make toes curl with pleasure. At the center is an exquisite, unforgettable Italian iris pallida, the single most exclusive material ever used in a Tanja Bochnig creation, a buttery, iridescent, rooty floral with exceptional fidelity, laid down into a lush, vibrant bed of equally gorgeous supporting notes: the sparkling brightness of Italian lemon, the narcotic sensuality of Indian tuberose and jasmine, the romantic fullness of Bulgarian rose, and the fiery cinnamon spice of Sri Lankan cassia. The combination is something beyond beautiful, achieving a blissfully full-bodied lusciousness that, in true April Aromatics fashion, sidesteps the stereotypes of natural perfumery to evoke grand, romantic fragrances of bygone eras. Sure, we might have said this fragrance was impossible to describe, but once we experienced the first spritz on skin, well- we simply couldn't resist."," Lemon, iris, jasmine, rose, tuberose, cassia, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65816.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kolonya Eau de Toilette,2107,Rasei Fort," Inspired by Rasei Fort's earliest childhood memories of time with his grandfather- his garden of blooming jasmine and lemon trees, the classic eau de cologne faded into his crisply starched shirt- Kolonya is an intensely personal scent, a true labor of love that echoes with the warmth of pleasantly fuzzy recollection. An imposing list of notes- citrus, spice, florals, moss, woods, resins- nonetheless coalesces into a hypnotically soothing whole, a smooth chord progression of gently wistful etherea that sits softly on the skin, yet will surprise you with moments of profound recognition throughout the day.

Oud for Greatness Eau de Parfum,2175,Initio Parfums," The concept of“sacred geometry, ” the inspiration behind Oud For Greatness,  is that recurring symbols and motifs- including the sacred scent of oud- are so powerful and holy that they are imbued with these hidden connections to the world at large,  transcending the material plane to align those who smell it with the vibrations of the universe. In other words,  experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical,  emotional,  and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness,  Initio taps into that hidden source of power,  delivering a vibrant,  sensual,  richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It's a highly concentrated blend of pure,  natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood,  a rich accord that melds the dark,  spicy,  sweet,  and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir,  both energetic and contemplative,  narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg,  while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake,  this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike. While it might seem inexact to say that a fragrance offers something for everyone,  we don't know how else to describe Oud For Greatness- we suppose a perfume this in tune with the hidden patterns of the world ought to smell this downright incredible."," Lavender, Saffron, Nutmeg, Natural Oud Wood, Natural Agarwood oil, Patchouli, Muscs",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/802005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Hyde Eau de Parfum,2809,Hiram Green Perfumes," A venomously enchanting potion to turn the meek into monsters, Hyde is an unforgettably dark and smoky leather spiked with bolts of green, spicy florals. A flash of bright citrus marks the start of the transformation, and is quickly overtaken with a sensually sinister smokiness that fills the senses and floods the imagination. As your perception adjusts, the intensity of the smoke makes way for the subtleties that lie within, courtesy of the Cassie flower, a unique relative of mimosa with distinctly spicy and fresh green characteristics. But Hyde is a beastly fragrance through and though, and even as the complexity grows, complete with resinous labdanum and smooth, malted vanilla, the overall effect is captivatingly dark, intensely powerful, and wholly unforgettable. Let the power of Hyde transform you, but be warned- there may be no turning back."," Lemon, bergamot, birch tar, acacia, cistus labdanum, malt, vanilla, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Red Square Eau de Parfum,1918,Mad et Len," Red is the color of passion, of warning, of danger. And what can we say? We hate to be all ”˜matchy-matchy', but Red Square sure lives up to its name! It scoops up some of the fieriest ”˜red' notes in perfumery, like red pepper, red musk, clove or cinnamon, and padauk wood, an African rosewood, and whips them up into a hot blaze, cooling them down again with ash and aromatics for a never-ending dance of hot and cold that holds the wearer's attention throughout. Key to Red Square's exciting aroma is nar (meaning ”˜fire' in Arabic), a rare red Boswellia sacra frankincense from Oman that has a fresh, spicy pine-like aroma pitched halfway between elemi and cinnamon bark. The opening is a column of white smoke billowing from a censer where elemi resin burns over eucalyptus branches, liquid tar, and cloves, its trail purified by an antiseptic ginger note. We love the minty, camphoraceous aspect of the incense, because it injects a leafy bitterness. Before we get too comfortable, however, Red Square plunges everything into a bath of hot pitch, like Eau Lente poured into the La Brea tar pits. This gutsy move is what transforms what could have been just a nice incense scent into something mesmerizingly different. The scent continues on in this spiced, musky tar-like track for a while before smoothing out into a peppery incense accord that reminds us of the aldehydic coldness of Avignon (Comme des Garcons) or LAVS (UNUM). We recommend Red Square to anyone who thinks that incense no longer holds any surprises. Although it riffs off the bone structure of some of the greats, Red Square takes us in some new and surprising directions."," padauk wood, red frankincense, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75227.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Noir Encens Eau de Parfum,2965,Mad et Len," Noir Encens is based on the scent of Mad et Len's beautiful Noir Encens potpourri – little nuggets of resin and wood soaked with frankincense essential oils – as well as the smoky, balsamic incense of an earlier release, the 2010 No. XLIII Encens. The 2018 Noir Encens takes the austere frankincense oil of the original and thickens it up with powdery tonka bean, velvety amber, and the rich booziness of amaretto, thus replacing High Mass with the coziness of a fireside on a cold winter's night, book in hand and cat on lap. The almondy heft of the tonka bean is both bitter in the cherry-amaretto sense of bitter and sweet in the marzipan sense of sweet - so perfectly balanced that you're never quite sure whether you're smelling the poison or the cure. One thing is for sure, though: Noir Encens is far more sensual than any incense scent has a right to be. Smelling it triggers both the desire to hibernate and to bite into someone's neck, so be careful. If you're driven to distraction by the balsamic, smoky, nigh on edible sexiness of fragrances such as FÃ¨ve DÃ©licieuse by Dior PrivÃ©e, Hypnotic Poison by Dior, or Le Baiser du Dragon by Cartier, then you can't afford to miss out on Mad et Len's 2018 Noir Encens."," amber, frankincense, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75225.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Changing Constance Eau de Parfum,2511,Penhaligons," Sister to Lady Blanche, Constance is what one would call a very modern woman. Her opening blend of cool cardamom and hot pimento is modern, to say the least, and is bound to deliver a dynamically fresh and spicy thrill. Still possessing a mild affinity to her favourite childhood treat, Constance can always be found sucking on a butter salted caramel as she twirls her Turkish cigar, clad in perfectly tailored cashmere trousers. Irreverent, stylish, and unquestionably contemporary, Changing Constance isn't a fragrance for every woman, which is assuredly exactly the way she likes it."," Cardamom, pimento, salted butter, caramel, tobacco, vanilla, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

And The World Is Yours Extrait de Parfum,1437,A Lab on Fire," Few photographs capture the sumptuousness of celebrity more than the iconic photograph of Faye Dunaway by famed English photographer Terry O'Neill. The starlet sits poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel at 6 a.m., hungover from winning an Oscar, sanguine in a pale silk robe, newspapers in a moat around her feet declaring her victor. And who better to pay homage to this most Hollywood morning-after, but Dominique Ropion, master of the doe-eyed and disheveled A Lab On Fire classics What We Do In Paris Is Secret and Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out Of Bed?And the World Is Yours kicks off with a blast of neroli that floods the senses, rich and fresh with the thrilling energy of a papparazzo's flashbulb. With a dramatic sigh, the neroli gives way to a warm, creamy orange blossom, enhanced with a flattering kick of spice. Ropion's signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope””apropos for the Hollywood sensuality. And just like the shimmering sunsets of Los Angeles, it melts into a honeyed, musky, golden finish. Like Dunaway in the photograph, And the World Is Yours is stylish, sexy- and still basking in the afterglow of last night's adventures."," Neroli, cumin, orange blossom absolute, rose, heliotrope, sandalwood, vanilla pod CO2,  tonka absolute, tolu balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56716.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
But Not Today Extrait de Parfum,2976,UNUM," UNUM's But Not Today is named for that chilling moment in Silence of the Lambs when Dr. Hannibal Lecter sniffs Clarice Starling and leers,“You use Evian skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today”. But Not Today is UNUM's scented capsule of the tension of that moment, where the pearly innocence of L'Air du Temps' carnation and lily, as worn by the fresh-faced Clarice Starling, faces off against the depraved bloodlust of castoreum, blood, and metal knives slicing through air, as represented by Hannibal himself. But Not Today's bloodcurdling mix of sweet indoles with blood, dust, and metal makes for an unsettling but strangely beautiful wear. But Not Today would be a great choice for anyone who prefers smelling interesting to merely pretty. Past the animalic roar of the bloody leather at the start, the scent develops into a spicy-floral gourmand that combines the culinary herb-and-spice-rack of Italian perfumery with creamy white flowers, freshened with the peppery greenness of lily. The powdery carnation that emerges in the base gives the scent an alluring ”˜old school' vibe redolent of the spicy leather drydowns of Caron's Tabac Blonde and En Avion. But Not Today is therefore that rare bird - possessed of both an avant-garde and retro character, but dominated by neither. But Not Today smells unique and doesn't compare easily to other fragrances. However, if you love scents such as Eva Kant by O'Driu, Vierges et Toreros by Etat Libre d'Orange, and Noun by Bogue, cut with the retro spice powder of L'Air du Temps and Tabac Blond, then waste no time in getting your nose on But Not Today."," Metal, lily, jasmine, leather, castoreum, carnation, animal notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71915.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Violon Basse 16 Extrait de Parfum,1928,Filippo Sorcinelli - SAUF," Thunderously dark, imposingly deep, Violon Basse 16 is a virtuosic performance of bassy, rich, impossibly smoky leather. Drawing its name from a wood or metal organ register that adds rich, imposing effect to the notes played, the scent more than replicates this function, lending the wearer a supernaturally powerful smokiness given subtle nuance with striking incense tones and dark notes of wood and leather. Sensual doesn't even begin to describe it- this is entrancing, primordial, sublime. Lovers of smoke scents- do not miss Violon Basse 16.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Unda Maris 8 Extrait de Parfum,1369,Filippo Sorcinelli - SAUF," Unda Maris (""wave of the sea"") is an organ stop that plays two pipes of differing registers together, the higher and lower notes producing a rolling sound evocative of the flowing ocean. An olfactive version of this effect is at the center of Unda Maris 8, which features a montage of bright, fresh, and authentically oceanic notes (though without an official notes list, we're left to guess) against a ""lower register"" of warm, resinous woodsy and incensey tones, creating a beautiful and ever-evolving series of harmonies. One moment, the fragrance is all salty air and citrus zest, the next, warmly textured, spiced florals and incense- but always defined by the negative space between the highs and lows. It's not so much a shapeshifter as a fragrance of consistent mass but infinitely variable dimensions, each moment a new permutation to enjoy. Flowing, fascinating, and deeply soothing, Unda Maris 8 is that rare gem that perfectly delivers on a high concept while remaining oh so wonderfully wearable.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
L'Heure Exquise 2020 Extrait de Parfum,1973,Bortnikoff," Spring in Paris has almost become summer today. The shades of evening begin to descend. You sit in a cafe in the city center and look at the Seine. The sun goes down and the colors of the day mix with the purple sky. The familiar outlines of objects are faded by pastel tones, your eyes rest, and your feelings become stronger. The waiter brings you a cup of cocoa and a dessert. Dusky air cools your face and you feel the richness of scents brighter than ever before: the beverage, the food and a bouquet of flowers nearby. It is L'heure Exquise. The fragrance starts with a soft mix of Cardamom and Citruses. In a moment you get into a whirlpool of spicy notes of Cocoa, Clove and Myrrh. The heart of the fragrance beats with floral notes of exotic Champaca and Jasmine. Indonesian and Vietnamese Oud, Tolu Balsam and delicate White Amber are warming the beautiful base of the fragrance.Same formula, new 2020 batch with a re-worked, smoother Oud accord"," Bergamot, neroli, cardamom, champaca, champaca leaf, jasmine, attar motia, cedar, cacao, clove, camphor, nagarmotha, myrrh, Vietnamese oud roots, Indonesian oud, styrax, tolu balsam, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Southern Bloom Perfume Concentrate,1838,Goldfield & Banks," Though originally native to Western Australia, the boronia- a rare flowering shrub with a distinctive sweet and woodsy aroma- has thrived in the wilds of Tasmania. Now it's the centrepiece of Southern Bloom, the newest, most elegantly feminine release yet from Goldfield & Banks. Featuring a pure boronia flower absolute harvested from ruggedly beautiful Bruny Island during the renowned September ""Spring Bloom"" season, Southern Bloom is lavishly romantic, with smooth, rich white florals enhancing the sweet sophistication of the central ingredient, while a suite of fresh and earthy notes- French cassis, native Australian sandalwood, and Javan vetiver- sustains and celebrates boronia's more unique characteristics. The results are a floral scent both refined and naturalistic, where floral sweetness, creamy woodsiness, and earthy green tones mesh seamlessly. As a proof of Goldfield & Banks' thesis that exquisite natural materials ought to be showcased in all of their three-dimensional glory, it's already a winner. As a versatile, sensual floral appropriate for any occasion, it's downright marvelous."," Tasmanian boronia, cassis, mandarin, ylang ylang, jasmine, iris, vetiver, sandalwood, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79506.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
I Am Trash Eau de Parfum,1797,Etat Libre d'Orange," Put aside the marketing for a minute - no, I Am Trash (or Les Fleurs du DÃ©chet) does not smell like trash! Etat Libre d'Orange is a brand known for making high concept art, and this is no exception. In I Am Trash, the idea is to raise awareness about the continued usefulness of the things that normally get thrown away, and find a way to upcycle these items to create something beautiful in its own right. I Am Trash is a perfume made entirely from ”˜found objects' like the fruit peels and wood chips leftover from extraction by the perfume or food industry. This makes perfect sense. After all, some of the most exquisite materials in perfumery derive from waste. Ambergris, for example, is effluvia from a whale washed up on a beach. Oud is a tree's white cell response to a fungal infection. And so on and so forth. But fear not, for I Am Trash is as far from the ruder, dirtier aspects of nature's waste as you can imagine. It is a gentle fruity-floral that wraps a woodland bouquet of wild strawberries, apple, rose, and citrus rind up in a frothy musk and asks you to forgive it its dramatic back story. Nothing dark or rotting lurks in the corners. This is a purely bright, sunny concoction of fruits and flowers, with clean musks, radiant Iso E Super, and a dab of creamy sandalwood in the base pinning it all together. Etat Libre d'Orange could have named this I Am Joy and nobody would blink. But we love the name I Am Trash because it's a reminder to be more thoughtful about what we throw away, and testament to the fact that, sometimes, out of trash comes true beauty."," bitter orange, apple, lemongrass, tangerine, rose, Iso E Super, wild strawberry, Atlas cedar, Sandalore, Akigalawood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47753.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Noble XXI Cypress Parfum,1932,Clive Christian," Clive Christian Cypress is a beautifully-made masculine that manages to capture the magic of a French Riviera night, where the spicy greenness of the breeze sweeping through tall cypress trees mingles with the effervescence of freshly-poured champagne. Think F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda boozing it up in a citrus grove in Nice, the tinkle of laughter and light jazz floating on the warm night air, and that's the mood board right there for the scent. The opening to Cypress is surprisingly spicy, thick with cloves, cinnamon, ginger root, and the anisic mintiness of fresh basil. But it's also immensely fresh and sour, a lively undercurrent of tart bergamot playing off the green bitterness of cypress. Fans of the balsamic soapiness of Jaipur Homme will recognize echoes in Cypress, but where the Boucheron burrows deep into an opoponax base, Cypress swerves into an elegant essay on the dry richness of woods. In the base, a handsome pairing of oakwood and cedarwood knits together a rich weave of smoke, toasted wood, and spice until you can't tell where one ends and the other begins. In the far reaches of the scent, rich amber swells up to thicken the woods, adding weight but not sweetness. If anyone is feeling short-changed by the dearth in good masculines these days, then point them in the direction of Clive Christian Cypress – they won't be disappointed."," petitgrain, bergamot, basil, cypress, clove, ginger, nutmeg, amber, oakwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Champ de Fleurs Eau de Cologne,3000,L'Artisan Parfumeur," Anne Flipo revisits of one of her most influential perfumes: 1999's La Chasse Aux Papillons. An impossibly soft, transparent tuberose that spells out spring in capital letters. In Champ de Fleurs, Flipo keeps the airy white floral in place, but takes it in a new and interesting direction. First, she freshens the topnotes with bitter grapefruit and a juicy pear note, giving the floral heart an icy ”˜morning dew' feel. Second, perhaps more significantly, she bolsters the airy tuberose with a creamy, full-fat pairing of gardenia and jasmine, so that the contrast between the fresh eau de cologne-style notes in the opening and the buttery floral heart feels even more dramatic. Velvety, creamy, and hovering somewhere between suggestive and innocent, Champ de Fleurs lingers on the skin and in the air for hours. It melts into the muskiness of your own skin, forming an aura that will leave people wondering if you're perfumed or have just been luxuriating in a long, steamy bath with honey and milk soap. Like La Chasse Aux Papillons and Chanel Beige, Champ de Fleurs is suggestive of springtime meadows but in an abstract, impressionistic way – you smell the gardenia, the tuberose, and the crisp green muguet not as a living, breathing flower per se, but as a gently creamy floral watercolor that swirls all the colors together. Unabashedly feminine, we see Champ de Fleurs as the perfect choice for those who prefer a discreetly luxurious symphony of spring flowers over the loud, fleshy sexiness of a tuberose or gardenia solo."," grapefruit, pear, jasmine, lily of the valley, cedar, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Pavillon Rouge Eau de Parfum,2151,Jovoy Paris," Dashingly spicy, mouthwateringly rich, Pavillon Rouge is an intriguingly unisex gourmand fragrance inspired by an age where pirates, admirals, and merchants all sought their fortune on the high seas. It's a dashing galleon flying the Jolly Roger, holds laden with exotic spices, glimmering treasure in dark wooden chests, and warm, rich liquors. It's the sensual elegance of a masked privateer clad in colorful silks and well worn leather, puffing a billowing pipe as he recounts adventures past and lovers left behind. Sweet and spicy, rich and boozy, tobacco, rum, and vanilla, all combine in a sweepingly romantic fragrance that boldly declares that a short, exciting life is infinitely preferable to a long and boring one. Throw off the doldrums of everyday life, and try Pavillon Rouge today- it's high time you started an adventure."," Spices, sesame, whisky, rum, coffee, tobacco, tea, leather, vanilla, ebony wood, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61616.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Forty Thieves Eau de Parfum,2098,Fort & Manle," From dusk ”˜til dawn,  a vast desert land, Camel caravans through the golden sand. Among the Bedouins they would retreat,   Surrounded by tea,  spices and delicacies to eat.A warm breeze carries the incense smoke,   Laughter around the shisha as they joke.  At nightfall,  they return to their coveted treasure,  Hidden in a cave,  it's a sight of pleasure.“Open Sesame”,  enter if you please,  To the mystical tale of the Forty Thieves.The latest in Fort & Manle's stunning slate of gorgeous,  idiosyncratic fragrances,  Forty Thieves is a sweet,  lush,  mouthwatering gem of a scent that weaves as dashing a tale as the original legend of Ali Baba himself. Vivid bursts of juicy bergamot and crackling pink pepper evoke the swirling oasis of the legendary hidden cave,  while a richly resinous floral heart suggests the untold treasures that lay within. A robustly balsamic base boasts sensusal warmth,  combining the comfort of vanilla with the deep mysteries of oud,  resulting in the unique balance of delightful wearability and utter originality that seems to distinguish every Fort & Manle scent. At the risk of overstating the theme,  Forty Thieves is undeniably worth its weight in gold."," Bergamot, pink pepper, petitgrain, incense, labdanum, papyrus, rose, honey, orange blossom, amber, sandalwood, oud, vanilla, balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78119.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Love & Crime Eau de Parfum,2502,Ex Idolo," In 1905, a lovestruck young woman named Mazie Coyle devised a scheme to break her fiancee out of prison that would later become legendary- a hacksaw baked into a wedding cake. It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break."," Red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Dark Lord Eau de Parfum,1123,By Kilian," Dangerously sophisticated, Dark Lord is both a fragrance of impeccable manners and seductive wickedness. It's a scent for gentlemen and scoundrels alike, both bold and subtle, constructed around a rich, gorgeous extract of raw Haitian vetiver and an intriguing blend of fruit-inflected, bright Sichuan pepper and electric bourbon pepper, smoothed behind a refined facade of leather and rum. Each supporting note- spicy, sweet, boozy, smooth, and earthy- coaxes out a corresponding facet of the vetiver, resulting in a men's fragrance with impressive versatility- in an office, worn with a sensible suit, it exudes suave, dignified elegance, while simultaneously adding a dangerous allure to a night out on the town- exactly what Kilian Hennessy had in mind from the beginning. Sure, you're just a regular, mild-mannered guy- but with a dash of Dark Lord, you can be so much more."," Bergamot, sichuan pepper, bourbon pepper, davana, rum, jasmine, vetiver, cypriol, cedar, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425200.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Princesses de Malabar Eau de Parfum,2291,Lubin," Legends tell of the mythical Princesses of the Malabar coast of western India, wise women who ruled their kingdom with wisdom and equanimity; in the 18th century, their tale became a shorthand for gracious, fair, female leadership. Now, in a time where that quality is disappointingly ephemeral, Lubin delivers a fragrance meant to inspire and enchant a new generation of empowered women. Bursting with fruity-floral energy that floats into a gorgeously weightless cloud of powdery musk, Princesses of Malabar is a bridge between past and present, a thoroughly modern and delightful feminine scent with an undeniable link to the glamorous perfumes of centuries past. Princesses of Malabar opens with the dynamic sparkle of aldehydes and citrus, a bathing light that cleanses palette and soul to make way for the rich but never-heavy fruity floral base- a juicy spritz of peach, the sumptuous lushness of magnolia, the sexy-sweet combination of jasmine and ylang. It's every bit as fun and youthful as the latest mass market blockbuster, only a thousand times more sophisticated. The contrast is only heightened in the vintage-inspired base, which deploys the powdery strength of iris atop a pillow-soft confection of amber, musk, and tonka, flirting with the mouthwatering appeal of a gourmand while never tipping into over-sugared dessert territory. It's a sublime formula, as fun as it is formal, as sweet as it is smooth, as fresh as it is fancy- a 21st century feminine scent for the young at heart and old souls alike. We could all use a bit of royal inspiration in these trying times, and Princesses de Malabar seems destined to become a new classic."," Cotton flower, bergamot, peach flesh, white magnolia, Arabian jasmine, Nosy Be ylang ylang, white musk, iris powder, sandalwood, sweet amber, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/312028.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Liquid Illusion Eau de Parfum,2325,Juliette Has a Gun," Liquid Illusion opens with such a lush, fruity almond note that we instantly picture Marie Antoinette wearing it, giggling with girlfriends as she nibbles on pastel-colored petit fours.  It's over-the-top delicious. Heliotrope, the tiny purple flower that smells like cherries and marzipan, ramps up the nutty gourmandise of this opening, but also ushers in a tart floral freshness that breathes air into the rafters. But Liquid Illusion is not just a fluffy gourmand delight (although it's certainly that, too). After a while, you become aware of the scaffolding beneath, with its complex system of cantilevers designed to keep those almond topnotes aloft. In particular, iris absolute, its shy aroma strengthened and made incredibly diffusive by irone and iracine (iris root oil compounds), casts a berried, violety forcefield around the scent. Tuberose absolute shows up, but comes armed with a girlish bubblegum nuance rather than its usual full desk of indole and rubber. The mix of all these floral and fruit elements is irresistible because it teeters on the line between innocent and seductive, girlish and come-hither. Benzoin imparts a gritty, brown sugar texture to the base that will make you want to bite your arm, but the real stars are the creamy tonka bean and musks, back-up generators of real balsamic warmth. Liquid Illusion is just the thing for when things just feel really bleak; a floral that skips the usual arm's-length froideur of flowers and offers you delicious, seductive warmth instead."," Heliotropin, almond, iris absolute, irone, iracine, tuberose, tonka, benzoin, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40132.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Love Tuberose Eau de Parfum,2006,Amouage," Are you on a diet? Well, sorry, because Love Tuberose is destined to weaken your resolve. Amouage's second installment in its ”˜Secret Garden' series is an outrageously gourmand take on one of nature's most hot-headed blooms: tuberose. Eschewing all the green, vegetal, rubbery, and indolic facets normally associated with tuberose, Love Tuberose instead plays up all the creamiest, sweetest, and most buttery aspects of this sensuous flower until we arrive at a result that's less flower, more trÃ¨s leches cake. Picture this: layers upon layers of creamy white jasmine and tuberose petals soaked in condensed milk and pressed into a 10-layer white cake, bound together by an ethereal gardenia buttercream. Honestly, if you put this on and don't allow an involuntary groan of pleasure to escape your lips, then you're stronger than we are. The Chantilly cream note is delicious, its whipped creaminess blurring the indolic thrust of tuberose so that the flower becomes feather-soft and almost innocent. Love Tuberose turns the heat back on, though, with a salty, musky drydown that wears like a halo of salty gardenia, sun-kissed skin, and sandalwood. An unabashedly feminine scent, Love Tuberose's pearlescent ivory bottle is a perfect mirror of the frothy layers of tulle contained within. But would we deny a man a slice of white cake with buttercream frosting if he wanted it? No - this level of deliciousness deserves to be experienced by everyone."," tuberose, jasmine, gardenia, whipped cream, vanilla, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41894.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tonka 25 Eau de Parfum,1970,Le Labo," Le Labo's first release in three years, we think Tonka 25 was worth the wait. An addictively dark and warm fragrance, Tonka 25 captures the humid funk of a forest's undergrowth, teeming with the buzz of insects, seeds, and resin. True to form for any Le Labo fragrance, tonka is a part of the composition but not the whole story. The crushed almond heft of tonka bean absolute is detectable in the background, where it infuses the perfume with aromatic woodsmoke, but for us, the real star of the show is the cedar, followed by musk and orange flower.The Atlas cedar in Tonka 25 is spicy, humid, and almost dank, creating an impression of woodrot that's enhanced by a swirl of vegetal musks. For a moment, we're reminded of the animalic topnote of Oud 27, but this is less alien, far more human: warm, enveloping, and very sexy. The furred darkness of the woods and musk at the heart of Tonka 25 holds sway for much of the scent's life, but we'd be remiss in not mentioning the extraordinary orange flower absolute. Orange blossom's gift to Tonka 25 is a green, waxy brightness that feels like a honey candle glowing through a knot of hemp. Finally, enter styrax resin, blessing the drydown with a leathery, smoky richness. If you're looking for something that will comfort and titillate in equal measure, then put Le Labo Tonka 25 on top of your test list. Dark woods expanded by creamy animalic musks, crushed tonka, and smoky resin, backlit by silky orange flower....a glowering Heathcliff in a bottle.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

A Rose For... Eau de Parfum,2168,Floris London," Every rose is beautiful in its own special way; every novel combination of species, vintage and terroir combines to produce a rose with a scent all its own, not to mention a meaning and emotional impact unique to its lucky recipient. It's with this in mind that Floris has given us A Rose For, an utterly unique oriental rose scent built upon a sweeping, sumptuous bouquet of warm, deep Moroccan rose absolute and lush, rich Bulgarian rose oil. Balancing both the exquisite delicacy and intense power of the rose, A Rose For opens with an exotically fresh blend of tea, incense and cassis before making way for the complexity of the floral blend. A melange of spices and woodsy notes unfolds differently on everyone, coaxing out an unpredictably beautiful blend of smooth and vibrant that surprises even as it delights. And to truly drive home the individuality, each bottle of A Rose For comes with a gold calligraphy pen, for you to add your own name to the label and make your version of this exquisite floral a special edition of one."," Darjeeling tea, incense, cassis, red rose, orris, oud, sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/715025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ruby Perfume Oil,1237,Bruno Acampora," 80 years ago, Nestle launched the first bar of white chocolate, bringing the number of naturally-colored chocolate in the world to 3: dark, milk, and white. But in 2017, after 13 straight years of research and development, Barry Callebaut, one of the world's most respected artisanal chocolate makers, decided that the world was ready for a fourth color – pink! Derived from a special cocoa bean, Ruby is a 100% naturally pink chocolate that possesses a uniquely sour, berry-like fruitiness not present in other types of chocolate. It was a breakthrough for the confectionary business worldwide – and for perfumery too. Bruno Acampora's Ruby is the world's first fragrance based on the scent and taste of this extraordinary pink chocolate. Please take our word for it – it's luscious. Ruby opens with sour cherries enrobed in melted dark chocolate, a hint of booze, rose, and coffee playing around the edges like a smile. Cleverly emulating the fruitiness of Ruby chocolate, the creaminess of the cocoa notes is imbued with a streak of either redcurrant or blackberry, so you get both the milky sweetness and the tongue-tickling sourness that makes pink chocolate so unique. But before you're tempted to stick your entire arm in your mouth (it's that delicious), the perfume finishes in a blaze of that earthy, semi-funky 1970's style musk for which the Acampora brand is famous. If smelling like dark chocolate, berries, and a bodaciously sexy musk is your thing (and why wouldn't it be?), then get your nose on Ruby as soon as you humanly can."," Dark chocolate, rose, red berries, pink pepper, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37539.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Percival Eau de Parfum,1199,Parfums de Marly," Named for a mythical French thoroughbred, Percival is that rarest of wonders- a truly ageless masculine. Sure, we can picture a dashing racing horse thundering around an 18th century track to the delight of the aristocracy, but Percival is every bit as appropriate on a debonair gentleman in a pristine late-model luxury sedan, stylishly cutting his way through the bustling city night on his way to an exclusive gathering. With a subtle yet striking balance between citrus and aromatic notes, a richly masculine floral heart of lavender, violet and geranium, and a spiced, deeply woodsy base, this is the kind of scent that wears as perfectly on any man as an impeccably tailored three-piece suit- a timeless signifier of dignity and taste. Fresh, sensual and refined, Percival is bound to leave a lasting impression."," Bergamot, mandarin, aromatic notes, jasmine, violet, geranium, lavender, pink pepper, coriander, cinnamon, musk, woody notes, spices, pepper, nutmeg, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70027.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vetiverissimo Eau de Parfum,2299,Bruno Fazzolari," Vetiverissimo is Bruno Fazzolari (now creating scents under the FZOTIC label) at his most stripped-back and personal; it's the vetiver he made for himself. Calming and Zen-like, this is the vetiver you wear to relax and clear your mind. No topnotes to speak of, and no back-story either – just a superb quality vetiver dusted with a hint of warming spice, bleeding gradually into a protracted woody drydown. Wearing Vetiverissimo feels like doing a factory re-set on your nerves. With its matte, earthen dustiness and subtle spice, it smells less like a Western perfume and more like Mitti Attar, a traditional Indian distillation of clay into sandalwood oil that captures the scent of rain on red soil. A flicker of turmeric or saffron gives the earthy vetiver a little kick, but doesn't interrupt the smooth Zen flow of the scent. On paper, the rooty greenness of the vetiver seems to last forever, but on skin, it slides quickly and seamlessly into the warm embrace of polished woods, a balanced tandem of aromatic sandalwood and spicy, resinous cedar. Drying down into a smoky powder hovering between sandalwood paste and zukoh (incense powder), Vetiverissimo is a laid-back ayurvedic salve for frazzled tempers and city stress. In fact, it's so good we think it should be prescribed by doctors."," spice, vetiver, cedar, resins, woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69314.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lucid Dream Eau de Parfum,1602,Ex Idolo," Lucid Dream is an olfactory exploration of the semi meditative state in which a person is aware they are asleep but is able to control their surroundings, and an ode to the potential hidden in every one of us. Juxtaposing rich, bright notes of pink pepper and davana with smoky, meditative florals and incense, Lucid Dream truly feels like another plane of existence, an ethereal journey into a world where we follow our wildest artistic impulses and break through the creative blocks that may impede our waking lives. It's a vivid, yet ethereal, experience, simultaneously romantic and contemplative, with the outstanding ingredient quality and rich tonalities for which Ex Idolo is known. Will Lucid Dream make you a master of your own subconscious? While we can't guarantee it, with a scent this wonderfully evocative, you'll certainly be inspired to find out."," Pink pepper, davana, smoky osmanthus, rose, incense, white patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Flash Back In New York Eau de Parfum,1753,Olfactive Studio," What an interesting and original flanker! Like the fuzzy picture of a snowy New York avenue taken as its starting point, Flash Back in New York weaves rhubarb, apple, leather, and wood together so seamlessly that it's difficult to pick out the individual lines at first. But slowly, like the shape of a building or a person emerging from a blur of snowflakes, we are able to make out the earthiness of vetiver, its grey-brown smokiness illuminated in spots by the brightness of unripe fruit. If the scent begins in earth and fruit, it soon develops in a series of surprising directions that keep our interest engaged. One strand leads us off into a gently spicy tonka bean diversion, another into a smoky violet-and-saffron leather, and yet another into an aromatic woody finish. We especially love the contrast between the soft warmth of the cumin and tonka pushing against the milky coolness of the leather and papyrus. Just as in the original photo by Vivienne Gucwa, Flash Back in New York is all about the hard angles of light slicing through a fuzzy darkness. If you love either Santal 33 by Le Labo or Terre d'Hermes by Hermes but wish for a gentler, more diffuse take that's stunning on either a man or a woman, then try Flash Back in New York. Its woodsy, androgynous sexiness will appeal even to those who don't normally wear fragrance."," Cumin, clary sage, white linen, saffron, violet, Tuscan leather, jasmine, birch, papyrus, vetiver, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Woody Mood Eau de Parfum,2891,Olfactive Studio," With Woody Mood, perfumer Betrand Duchaufour reaches inside our head and pulls out all our fantasies of fall – crisp air, sweet woodsmoke, the crackle of leaves hitting the bonfire – compiling them into an autumnal essay that satisfies down to the bone. The inspiration for Woody Mood is Roger Steffens's 1973 photo of a woman wandering alone in a California redwood forest, shafts of sunlight piercing the gloom. Since Duchaufour is the father of perfume history's most influential woody-incense scents (Timbuktu, Avignon, etc.), it makes perfect sense that he was the perfumer chosen to translate the photo into fragrance form. Woody Mood opens with a buzz of whiskey-soaked wood, rich and wet, which quickly dries out into a ribbon of pure woodsmoke winding lazily through chill air. Aromatic sage and spikenard give the woods a masculine swagger, but we see this scent working beautifully on a woman's skin too. From the radiant blaze of woods emerges a core of rubbery black tea, cacao, and styrax, darkening the scent to the point where we're no longer sure whether we're smelling wood or leather. The contrast in Woody Mood between the peppery brightness of the woods and the darkness of burnt resin is a perfect mirror of the play of light on dark in the photo. Like Au Coeur du Desert, Woody Mood's genius lies in conjuring up a vivid chiaroscuro from a restricted palette of earth tones. If you love the radiant smokiness of woodsmoke without the additional weight of amber or cream, then this scent by Olfactive Studio is a no-brainer."," bergamot, ginger, clary sage, saffron, sequoia, spikenard (jatamansi), black tea, incense, patchouli, leather, styrax, cacao",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61514.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kings Wood Fragrance Concentree,2483,Shay & Blue," Not in the least bit like Aventus! Just putting that out there (we're aware that pineapple is a trigger word for some). No, Kings Wood takes the oft-abused pineapple and sets it among aromatic herbs and greenery for a gentlemanly English garden fougÃ¨re that's mercifully low on sugar. It's clean, aromatic, and above all, unpretentious. We love it. Although the topnote is clearly pineapple, it has a thrilling tartness that leans more on grapefruit and tart greenery than tropical cocktail. Its fougÃ¨re bone structure really comes into focus once that big, handsome oak note settles in, shoring up all the peppery herbs and fruit with its broad shoulders. Tilted towards the masculine side of the scale, Kings Wood belongs on the confident titan of industry who secretly dreams of being back in his garden, potting plants and hacking back overgrown brambles. The leather accord in the far drydown is a delightful late addition, ruffling the elegant surface of this gentlemanly fougÃ¨re with a surprisingly skanky note redolent of animal hide and undergrowth. We see Kings Wood working fantastically on a man (or woman) who loves the rustic vigor of herbs, fruit, oak, and good clean dirt but needs it packaged up into an elegant structure for a conservative setting."," pineapple, fern, Sichuan pepper, oak, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70418.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir Celeste Eau de Parfum,2649,Ex Nihilo," Does artistic talent transcend its medium? That's the question posed by Ex Nihilo's bold new Visionnaire series, which explores the answer by pairing renowned visual artists with Ex Nihilo perfumers to help them shape their artistic conceptions into actual scents. For the premiere of the series, they've teamed Ex Nihilo house perfumer Quentin Bisch with acclaimed photographer Mathieu Cesar, and the result is Cuir Celeste, an arrestingly modern, surprisingly nuanced leather scent with all the vibrant contrast of a museum-quality B&W print. Cuir Celeste opens with a clean, dry violet leaf accentuated with the quiet energy of a restrained black pepper note. The leather accord here strikes a compelling balance between gentle ambrette-laced florals and bitter galbanum, with cypriol providing a rich, dry, papyrus-like base anchored to the spicy and woodsy tones of akigalawood. The effect is modern, smooth, and intriguing- a scent that doesn't so much mimic the actual aromas of photography so much as it smells the way a photograph looks- a representation of reality through the lens of a creator. If you love modern floral leather, don't miss Cuir Celeste- it's a work of art."," Black pepper, violet leaf, galbanum, ambrette, osmanthus, patchouli, cypriol, akigalawood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
EO No. 1 EdP Eau de Parfum,1796,Ensar Oud," When Ensar released Sultan Leather Attar to overwhelming acclaim, he realized something- that even outside of his extraordinary pure oudh and sandalwood oils, fragrance connoisseurs were starving for rich, evocative blends that defy conventional trends. But to make an Eau de Parfum utilizing his unprecedented collection of exquisite natural materials, avoiding cheap, easy to use synthetics, was a major risk. Still, the people were calling out for an EDP. And now, here we are. And what does an all-natural Ensar Oud EDP smell like? We're sure you can imagine it involves oud and leather, and boy does it- a blend containing such jaw-dropping materials as bright, clean, powerful $2,500/3gr Kyaratul Mustafa oud oil, 13-year-aged wild Hainan sinensis extract, and precious, carefully aged rose oil from Sultan Qaboos's private collection. The results are wonderfully rich, the oud and leather sing of power and sophistication, the rose a perfectly lush counterpart adding  romantic depth. There's no barnyard funk to be found here, just the type of elegantly masculine warmth that a lady of style could also wear with aplomb. A luxurious flacon adorned with real, naturally tanned, pure full-grain Italian leather completes the vision. EDPs like this don't come around anymore- don't miss your chance to experience one."," rose, oud, leather, tobacco, tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/800014.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tyrannosaurus Rex Extrait de Parfum,1040,Zoologist," A sultry heat wafts across the land, lapped up greedily by the abundant flora that thrives in its midst. Trees soar to majestic heights and plants flower for the first time, their petals spreading to give birth to a world rich in diversity. The Cretaceous period comes of age against a backdrop scorched by wildfire and lightning strikes. Over this turbulent landscape, a massive predator looms. Giants rule the earth, but even giants can be cut down within the powerful jaws of the fearsome tyrannosaur. Standing tall, the terrifying beast fears nothing, until that pivotal moment when a fire in the sky signals the end of their deadly reign.Zoologist Tyrannosaurus Rex is a gargantuan scent that sinks its teeth into the world of delicate fragrances and rips it wide open. Primitive woods and florals seize you and snatch you away to an ancient era. Smoky, charred wood warns of the danger of smouldering fire, setting your senses on edge, while droplets of metallic rose oxide offer a chilling premonition of blood-lust. The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex is sometimes menacing, sometimes fascinating, but never, ever ordinary."," Bergamot, black pepper, fir, laurel leaf, neroli, nutmeg, champaca, geranium, jasmine, osmanthus, rose, ylang, resins, cade, cedar, civet, frankincense, leather, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Remember Me Eau de Parfum,1876,Jovoy Paris," Remember Me is an olfactory aide-memoire of an inspiring trip to Qatar that perfumer Cecile Zarokian took with Jovoy founder, Francois Henin. While in Doha, Cecile fell in love with the scent of Karak, a local chai made with lots of lush, sweet milk, cardamom, and ginger, the steam of which mingled companionably with the exotic mukhallats and bakhoor she was sampling. Combined with wafts of frangipani coming from the shady avenues of Doha, Remember Me is a memory capsule of these exotic but comforting scents.  Combining edible elements like milk, vanilla, and chai with less edible notes such as leather and wood, Remember Me is a modern, sophisticated gourmand - it avoids making you think directly of food. Everything here is remarkably well balanced. The chai is peppery hot with ginger, but calmed by a generous pour of steamy milk and vanilla. In turn, the creaminess of the tea is kept fresh by a duo of bergamot and cardamom threaded through the scent like a tart green ribbon. You'd be forgiven for looking at the notes for this – vanilla, frangipani, milk and so on – and assuming that it's a purely feminine affair. But no, it's 100% unisex! Unusually, what pulls Remember Me firmly into the center is the frangipani; the variety used here smells more like peachy suede than tropical flowers. Remember Me is a milky chai suede that comfortably occupies the meeting place between gourmand, oriental, and leather. If you love unusual, complex ”˜sweet' fragrances such as El Born by Carner Barcelona and Leder 6 by J.F. Schwarzlose, then Remember Me might be your new obsession."," Bergamot, lemon, cardamom, tea, frangipani, ginger, milk, woody notes, cedar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61615.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Le Participe Passe Eau de Parfum,1001,Serge Lutens," Do you love balsamic, resinous fragrances? Are you addicted to the radiant warmth, the languorous sweetness, the oriental spice? Serge Lutens certainly does, with deep, stylish accords of resin and balsam present in the background of many of his most classic scents. With Le Participe Passe, the always literate Lutens looks back on the oriental scents of his past, delivering a tribute to these cornerstones of perfumery written in indulgently pure richness. Featuring a spectacular overdose of smoothly powerful Egyptian balsam, Participe Passe deploys a full complement of resins, dried fruit, leather and caramel to further soften every sharp edge, leaving you in a dreamlike state of balsamic bliss. A delicate sprinkle of spice provides subtle sophistication, but this is a balsamic scent through and through, meant for those who simply can't get enough. If that's you, we'd advise you not to hesitate- Le Participe Passe is exactly what you're searching for."," Egyptian balsam, resins, caramel, cumin, leather, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36163.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Santal Nabataea Eau de Parfum,2188,Mona di Orio," Inspired by the shifting red, pink, and cream layers of the sandstone at Petra, Jordan, Fredrik Dalman wanted to create a perfume that might bring the memory of the 4th century BC Nabataean Kingdom, for whom Petra was the capital city, back to life. A nomadic tribe by nature, Petra was a touchstone for the Nabataeans, and the main focal point of trade in the region. Santal Nabataea honors the inspiration of Petra in two ways: via references to the exotic fruit and spices traded in Petra at the time, and by using certain materials to emulate the dusty, rosy colors and textures of the sandstone of this haunting city. And wow, does it succeed. In exploring the dusty and sometimes astringent heart of true sandalwood, rather than its famously creamy facet, Santal Nabataea is that rare thing – a perfume that smells genuinely exotic in and of itself, rather than simply stuffed with as many exotic notes the perfumer can think of. A pared-back structure demonstrates confidence in its own ability to deliver its message without unnecessary embellishment. All the other notes here exist to showcase the sandal – the black pepper creating a spicy darkness at the back of your throat, the coffee deepening its masculine growl, and the black currant leaf and apricot notes giving off a tannic tea-like nuance that matches the wood in astringency. If it's the brusque, aromatic dryness of real sandalwood that you love, then make sampling Santal Nabataea a priority. Featuring sustainably-sourced santalum album from Australia as well as Indian sandalwood, it's the (rare) real deal."," black pepper, black currant leaf, apricot, nerium oleander, opoponax, Australian santalum album sandalwood, Indian sandalwood, coffee",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51730.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tokyo Eau de Parfum,1795,Gallivant," It's 6 am in Tokyo as you make your way home through the quiet back streets, the air humid with early morning mist. As the electric cables above your head crackle and snap, a strange peace descends on the scene. Tokyo is finally at slumber, or at least in brief repose before gathering itself up again into the manic energy that courses through the city like a pulse. Gallivant's Tokyo captures the moment when Old Tokyo meets New, the sweet smokiness of Japanese incense of Kodo ceremonies spilling out of small wooden temples to meet the sweet-and-sour pungency of izakaya street food. There's a lot going on in Tokyo, the city, and so there's a lot going on in Tokyo, the scent. But despite the cacophony of notes, it all meshes into a singular statement on modern Japanese urban culture. The exciting buzz of yuzu and black pepper in the topnotes conjure the crackle of overhead electric cables swinging softly in the morning breeze, while wasabi, cardamom, and nutmeg lend a dash of complex sour-sweet flavoring to the brew. Tokyo smells intoxicating and strange; otherworldly in the way only exposure to a completely foreign culture can be. Japanese temple incense is the calm at the center of this storm, a cloud of gentle hinoki wood, smoke, and damp flower petals billowing out into the streets as we pass. Before the incense has a chance to turn to powder, a base of exuberantly-spiced ambers, patchouli, sandalwood, and musk moves in to drench the scent in the gold patina of orientalism. This might seem more Arabian-inspired than Japanese at first until you notice that the gentler Japanese accents persist, infiltrating the fog of resin with the aqueous, sweet-and-sour aroma of cardamom, the wasabi, and the silvery ephemerality of hinoki wood. Big city neon energy meets old world Tokyo: this scent brings us straight to the point where they intersect."," Yuzu, bergamot, black pepper, cardamom, wasabi accord, hinoki, cedarwood, nutmeg, iris, rose, incense, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/766007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
34 Boulevard Saint Germain EDP Eau de Parfum,2727,Diptyque," 34 Boulevard Saint Germain, the home of the original Diptyque boutique, is as close to a royal address as it gets in niche fragrance. Still alive almost 60 years after first opening its doors, ""The Maison"" is both an ever-evolving palace of luxury, and also a timeless shrine to its own origins, a magical space lined in rich waxed blond wood, vintage cabinets stuffed with fragrant curios, and the soft, warm comfort of sunlight streaming through the large, welcoming windows. The scent inside is an unknowable mix of every perfume sprayed, every candle displayed, and every raw material played with- a wholly unique form of olfactive serendipity. It's this complete aura, both the body and soul of the boutique, captured in 34 Saint Germain Boulevard Eau de Parfum. Perfectly balancing the warm, nostalgic tones of vanilla, sandalwood and tonka against a robust, multifaceted pink pepper, this EDP feels both modern and timeless, comforting and sensual, fresh and warm. Like the wondrous shop to which it owes its name, 34 Saint Germain Boulevard EDP is sure to cast a spell on all who discover it."," Pink pepper, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483250.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hemingway Eau de Parfum,1825,Masque Milano," Masque Milano has gained a well-earned reputation as a launching pad for young talent- a brand that takes chances on up-and-coming noses and gives them the freedom to discover their creative voices. So when they met IFF trainee Fanny Bal, apprenticing under the legendary Dominique Ropion, and heard of her facility and ingenuity with vetiver, a seed was planted. And who better to dedicate a scent built around vetiver- rough and spicy, earthy and sweet, rich and complex- than Ernest Hemingway? With access to the full resources of the Laboratoire Monique Remy, Bal produces a sweepingly literary tribute to vetiver built from an exquisite vocabulary: woody, dry and spicy Haitian vetiver, with a slight bitterness, provides ideal contrast for the tart rhubarb of the opening. Javan vetiver is dirtier, with smoky tones and leathery facets to blend with the patchouli and leather base. And proprietary Vetiver Heart LMR, which takes hydro-distilled vetiver and puts it through additional fractional distillation to isolate the clean, dry heart of the grassy material without the earthiness, anchors the heart of the fragrance."," Ginger, rhubarb, vetiver heart LMR, Haitian vetiver, Java vetiver, cedar, patchouli, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Viking Eau de Parfum,2455,Creed," This fall, The House of Creed introduces the masterfully crafted Viking, a fiery men's fragrance that bottles the fearless spirit of boundless exploration for the modern man who goes against the grain. Sixth Generation Master Perfumer Olivier Creed created Viking and was inspired by the incredibly crafted longships, a centrepiece of the Viking Age and one of the greatest design feats of the ninth century. A symbol of voyage and undeniable perseverance, longships were carefully designed for the skilled seaman who embodied unbridled determination to conquer. Viking marks the brand's first major men's scent since the introduction of the cult best-selling Aventus in 2010."," Bergamot, lemon, pink peppercorn, black pepper, rose, peppermint, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, lavandin absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49375.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Geisha Botan - Eau de Parfum,1973,Aroma M," The power of the peony in Japanese horticulture, and iconography, is overwhelming: peonies line the immaculate gardens of public parks and shrines throughout the country, not to mention their ubiquity in Japanese art from woodcutting to traditional irezumi tattooing. Now with Geisha Botan, Maria McElroy places the peony front and center, in a hypnotically pretty scent that's both youthful and sophisticated. Fresh peonies are the star, weaving their gentle honeyed lushness with a supporting dash of Bulgarian rose against a backdrop of soothing sandalwood and sensual vanilla with just a hint of animalic musk. It's a perfect floral for any occasion, casual enough to wear everyday, but with hidden depths for those who fall under its spell. Discover the quintessentially Japanese world of the peony with Geisha Botan."," Peony, rose, sandalwood, vanilla, velvet woods, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/11150.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mizu Eau de Parfum,1806,Di Ser," Mizu, meaning water in Japanese, combines zesty yuzu with spearmint for an aqua seltzer opening that feels like ice water running down your spine. It's the perfect palate cleanser, especially on stupid hot days when your brain seems to stop working. Although Mizu is technically a woody-aromatic citrus, you wouldn't mistake Mizu for a French or American eau de cologne. There's something intrinsically Japanese in its transparency, delicate sourness, and complex use of herbs. Mizu smells exotic, but subtly so. Moving effortlessly from its sparkling spearmint-and-yuzu topnotes to an earthy rosewood and vetiver base, its transitions are as smooth as flowing water. In the heart, it picks up a slight spiciness from the smattering of clovey pinks (carnations) and green cardamom, but it's a subtle accent rather than a plot point. Throughout, the tone is cool and astringent, the unami-rich rosewood and aromatics devoid of anything sweet or thickening. Mizu smells all-natural, because it is all-natural, but a Japanese lightness of touch keeps it from feeling muddy. Instead, Mizu wears like moonlight - peppery, silvery, and buoyant.

Tobacco Oud Intense Eau de Parfum,1257,TOM FORD Private Blend," Wonderfully soft, intriguingly smooth, the original Tobacco Oud was a soothing, yet thoroughly masculine scent that flirted with darkness, but never truly approached the edge. But sometimes, you don't want to play it safe, and Tobacco Oud Intense is more than happy to oblige, removing the training wheels from the original and amping up the spices, resins, and animalics to deliver a bolder, more daring Tobacco Oud guaranteed to turn heads and raise pulses. A sweeter, spicier vein of coriander pairs with a doubled-dose of castoreum, infusing every moment with raw, animalic magnetism that commands attention without ever turning sour, and the signature tobacco and oud combination is robustly masculine, smokier and unapologetically fiercer, while still displaying a sophisticated woodsiness. Rich and powerful, yet still tuxedo-appropriate, it's another knockout tobacco offering from Tom Ford you won't want to miss."," Coriander, tobacco, oud, labdanum, amber, sandalwood, cedar, tonka, castoreum, patchouli Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Tobacco Oud Intense by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Purple Flowers Eau de Parfum,2773,Mancera," Housed in a stunning ""Ultra Violet""-tinted bottle (the Pantone Color of the Year 2018), Purple Flowers more than lives up to its bold presentation, delivering a rounded, vibrant, deeply woodsy floral scent that should entrance Mancera lovers and newcomers alike. Eye-popping bursts of citrus balance against a lush, rose-led floral bouquet made tantalizingly unisex by a rich, complex spice blend- pepper, ginger, and nutmeg. As it dries, the florals become sweetly ambered, weaving in woodsy and creamy tones warm enough to feel comfortable, yet still airy enough for a year-round sexiness anyone can rock in style. It's the perfect fragrance to complement the Color Of The Year: delightfully attention-grabbing at first, yet ultimately so wonderfully balanced that the hundredth time you experience it is every bit as satisfying as the first."," Mandarin, nutmeg, ginger, black pepper, elemi, fig tree, rose, patchouli, cedar, grey amber, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64935.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ruh Eau de Parfum,1832,Pekji," Ruh, meaning spirit in Sanskrit, is the collective scent of an air-conditioned souk in Turkey, where the delicious aromas of freshly-ground coffee, exotic spices, and incense mingle companionably with the scent of rose attars opened for passers-by. Ruh is exotic in an unfamiliar manner, rearranging traditionally-used notes like rose, coffee, and cardamom in a way that doesn't make you think of every other souk-themed oriental out there. And that's a rare feat. Ruh is rich, but not sweet or heavy. Roast coffee and crushed green cardamom pods pump a fragrant, aromatic freshness through the scent's cells, giving the Turkish rose a spiced wood character that men will love and find easy to wear. A blast of fiery saffron is a further nudge in the direction of masculine, wrapping the lush rose into folds of freshly-tanned leather. But the saffron is the real chameleon of Ruh; it softens in increments from inky iodine to the gently spiced milkiness of kulfi, turning the scent's dial from dry to lush. Breathe in Ruh, close your eyes, and you will feel the soul of the souk all around you, redolent with rich black coffee, piles of red saffron and green cardamom, Turkish leather jackets, and tiny bottles of rose attars opened, sniffed, and dabbed. Yep, Ruh has soul. Luca Turin thought so too, awarding Ruh a 4 star rating in The Perfume Guide (2018)."," rose, coffee, cardamom, saffron, jasmine, oud, musk, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Zeybek Extrait de Parfum,2917,Pekji," Zeybek, which takes its name from an expressive Aegean dance for a solo male, is an animalic fougere that smells a bit like the minty chewing gum breath of a cowboy as he rakes out a horse stall. The way Zeybek teeters precariously between herbal freshness and smeary funk the whole way through is as electrifying as being plugged into a live socket. For us, Zeybek revolves around a handful of key aromatics that are so complex that they spin the scent off in several directions at once. Narcissus, yes, innocent little daffodil, exudes the fresh greenness of cut stalks, but also facets of soiled hay, civet, and jasmine, which creates a 3D picture of a horse stall. The central ”˜flowers in a barnyard' accord is freshened up top with salty herbs, lavender, and lemon, for an effect that smells like spearmint gum mixed with sea water. This thrillingly odd combination rests on an equally odd base of industrial notes such as rubber, gum, and putty, all shot through with cigarette ash. Engaging and completely different from anything we've ever smelled before, we'd call Zeybek an animalic fougere that's both resolutely modern and naturalistic in feel. The only cost of entry here is a sense of adventure and the refusal to be hemmed in by convention."," bergamot, hay, lavender, leather, lemon, musk, narcissus, tobacco, tonka, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Odoon Extrait de Parfum,1288,Pekji," A masterful treatise on a single material, Odoon takes us on a journey through the stored memory cells of a piece of wood, from the depths of the forest to the workshops, from sap to the burnt ashes in the grate of a fire. Odoon is wonderfully rich, balsamic, and warm – full of character and complexity despite its obsessive, almost singular focus.  The structure is remarkably uncluttered, focusing on exposing each facet of wood and turning it over for our attention. First, we smell the minty camphor of a freshly bladed log of wood, sap springing up as if startled by its sudden release. Then the roast coffee warmth of cedar, its peppery mealiness exposed to the air for the first time. Slowly, the wood dries out to the caramelic dryness of sandalwood awaiting the carver's tool, where it is polished to a high shine. It all comes together in a wisp of smoke and ash, nuggets of resin in the fine grain catching on fire here and there at the edges. Odoon is warm, deep symphony of wood notes that somehow transcends the simplicity of structure to take on a soul. If you love any of the Comme des Garcons woods-themed fragrances (Wonderwood, Sequoia, Hinoki, and so on), and want to see what a more natural, artisanal take smells like, then get yourself some Odoon."," ash, cedar, guaiacwood, musk, oak, pepper, pine, resins, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Battaniye Extrait de Parfum,1066,Pekji," Battaniye, meaning blanket in Turkish, is a technically what we might term a comfort scent. Well, you see amber and patchouli, and you draw your own conclusions. But to leave it at that does the scent's enormous complexity a great disservice. Because, although undeniably rich and comforting, Battaniye leans far more towards the dry warmth of textiles – wool, leather, silk – than it does dessert.   The perfumer intended for Battaniye to evoke the feeling of watching the rain from a balcony in Trabzon, a mountainous town on the Black Sea, and once an important gateway to Persia on the Spice Route. And it certainly captures the aromas of such a scenario – the scent of rain hitting soil, soot from chimneys, and the oily warmth of an old wool blanket pulled across one's legs to ward off the chill. But for us, Battaniye is all about leather. A spicy, molten core of leather roiling at the heart fuels the scent and gives it a resolutely masculine feel. It morphs slowly from a syrupy wetness that's almost animalic to the dusty warmth of old leather. Surprisingly, for a scent with so many oriental references, Battaniye comes off as distinctly Western, with a cowboy's dusty leather saddle firmly at the heart of things. Battaniye is comfort, yes, but it's the comfort of memory and atmosphere, not that of pudding."," amber, honeysuckle, java vetiver, labdanum, musk, patchouli, soil, soot, wool",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eaumer Eau de Parfum,2492,Pekji," Eaumer, a play on the perfumer's name (O-Mer), is the tonic we'd prescribe to anyone who's ever had a bad experience with an aquatic. Forget what you know about this genre, with its overdose of Calone and potent aromachemicals – Eaumer is here to turn the concept of aquatic on its head and reconfigure all your expectations. When you wear Eaumer, the most pleasant surprise is that a scent can be naturally rather than chemically marine-fresh. Salty anise, lime, and vetiver combine to evoke the brackish freshness of a sea breeze, mercifully free of the melony sweetness common to most aquatics. The lime note sluices everything with an antiseptic brightness that will jolt you awake. The natural gasoline and rubber facets of jasmine are brought forward and accentuated, cleverly creating a petrol-on-sea-water effect that feels novel but also refreshing. When all is said and done, though, ambergris is the rock on which Eaumer is built. Redolent of minty tobacco, minerals, and sea salt, the ambergris fills the scent with a radiant freshness, but also a lingering mammalian funk. And it's this contrast between bright and murky that makes Eaumer such a pleasure to wear on a hot day."," ambergris, anise, bergamot, Haitian vetiver, herbs, jasmine, lavender, lime, mastic, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
B-612 Extrait de Parfum,2568,Nishane," In Antoine de Saint-Exupery's beloved children's book Le Petit Prince, the titular Prince is the only living being to come from a far-away asteroid known only as B-612. Traveling the universe, the Prince carries with him the spirit of imagination, open-mindedness and inquiry that he cultivated on B-612, and thus, the fragrance named for the asteroid is meant to convey that same spirit- as they put it, ""enlightenment through exploration."" So it should come as no surprise that B-612 is a dynamic, lively, and richly beautiful scent, combining classically aromatic and floral notes of geranium and lavender with a deeply woody heart and a warm, comforting base of oakmoss and tonka bean to create something compellingly timeless. While the result feels sophisticated and masculine, B-612 never loses sight of its joyfully childlike inspiration- this is a scent to wear on adventures, journeys, and new experiences with old friends. The Little Prince has taught generations of readers to hold fast to the wonder and goodwill that far too many lose when approaching adulthood- B-612 is an olfactive reminder that one need never let it go."," Lavender, geranium, cypress, cashmeran, cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, oakmoss, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vain & Naive Extrait de Parfum,1862,Nishane," ""It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.""The character of the Rose in Le Petit Prince is an extremely important one- she is the Prince's true love, a beautiful, yet flawed companion whose vanity and naivete initially drives the Prince to leave his home asteroid, only for him to ultimately realize that for all her flaws, she is a unique being worthy of his love. With Vain & Naive, Nishane honors the Rose in all her wondrous complexity, delivering an airy, lovely fruity floral rose scent with unforgettable flair. Vain & Naive opens with an arrestingly bright burst of citrus, then quickly introducing the florals at its heart- a rose and jasmine combination both youthfully fresh and romantically lush. Mouthwatering notes of plum and raspberry keep things lively and light, while a gently ambered, woody base glows with soulful depth. The Little Prince ultimately opts to return to his asteroid, and his Flower- for all her vanity and naivete, his love for her is undeniably real and inherently worthwhile. One sniff of Vain & Naive, and you'll never want to leave in the first place."," Bergamot, orange, rose, jasmine, cedar, plum, raspberry, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, benzoin, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77422.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hyouge Eau de Parfum,2021,Parfum Satori," 6th century tea master Oribe Furuta fiercely adhered to the teaching of Sen Rikyu to“always be different from others” and injected a fearless and liberated sense of beauty into the world of the tea ceremony.  His Hyouge (humor) pottery, called Oribe-yaki, with its characteristic dark green and black designs, appears modern, even by today's standards.As a fragrance designed to honor both the man himself and the exquisite art to which he dedicated his life, Hyouge is a fresh, floral green tea scent with uniquely Japanese nuance.From the gently powdered green freshness of the very first moments, it's clear that Hyouge is not just a tea scent, nor even just a green tea scent- it's a matcha scent, rich yet subtle, powdery yet bright, with an evocatively complex interplay of softly bitter and sweet notes. Iris and violet further the nuance, eschewing typical floral lushness for a smooth, powdered, gently woodsy base. As you might expect, Hyouge is a quiet scent, but like a true Sado ceremony, there's not a wasted movement- each detail is a touch of perfect, deliberate beauty. Matcha lovers- your new obsession has arrived.(Note: Trademark/name of“Oribe” has changed to“Hyouge”)"," Green tea, sage, jasmine, violet, patchouli, woods, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Komorebi Eau de Parfum,1233,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale"," Komorebi: a Japanese term that refers to the beauty of natural sunlight filtered through the forest canopy, and the glowing, deciduous effect it creates. It represents a connection between land and sky, with the tree acting as the perfect intermediary, connected closely to both air and earth, a conduit for light, energy, and life itself. Komorebi captures that connection in a gorgeously delicate aromatic floral, combining the bracing freshness of wild mint with a rich, gently sweet bouquet of reseda and mimosa and a blackcurrant note both juicy and aromatic. In the softly powerful base, hazelnut and smooth, lightly powdered tonka bean support a potent central note of oak wood. There are many forest-themed scents, each with their own balance between light and dark, earth, air, and vegetation- but as an impossibly luminous tribute to the forest at its lightest and brightest, Komorebi stands alone."," Mint, reseda, mimosa, blackcurrant, hazelnut, oak, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34554.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Orange X Santal Eau de Parfum,2343,Essential Parfums," Orange X Santal, literally orange crossed with sandalwood – simple, handsome, and to the point. A radiant composition, the scent focuses on the meeting of a remarkable bitter orange note with the authentic creaminess of santalum album grown sustainably on Australian plantations, the same species of wood that gave us the original Mysore sandalwood. Orange X Santal keeps the structure uncluttered, allowing the raw materials to speak for themselves. The orange turns from juicy pulp to aromatic rind, before settling in a salty, metallic register that feels wonderfully bracing. The aromatic bitterness of the citrus is further underlined by a chorus of dark green notes, chief among them real oakmoss, a rugged cypress, and minty basil, all of which work to lend the scent a chypric tone. The creaminess of the sandalwood in the base is exquisite, but the scent holds fast to its basic character of salty woods, moss, and orange to the end, never ceding to sweetness. Leaning masculine? Yes, we think so. There is something about its brisk, mossy bitterness of Orange X Santal that suits a man, especially if he's wearing a conservative but light summer suit."," Bitter orange, Egyptian basil, natural oakmoss absolute, cypress, Australian santalum album",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Rose Magnetic Eau de Parfum,2608,Essential Parfums," Rose Magnetic is a great example of what Essential Parfums sets out to do, which is to zone in on a great natural material and then hire great perfumers to create a simple but elegant structure where it can shine like a perfectly-polished stone. As addictive as its name suggests, Rose Magnetic takes us on a playful tour through all the fresh, sour, and fruity facets of the rose, before softening into the fluffy almond deliciousness of a Pierre Hermes Ispahan macaron.   In the opening, bitter grapefruit and leafy mint play up the spicy herbaciousness of rose, giving rise to the kind of sourness that makes your mouth water. In the heart, the solvent-distilled rose gives way to the lusher Turkish rose absolute, whose pert sweetness is fleshed out with an addictively juicy litchi note. Swirls of creamy musks, vanilla, and natural tonka bean fluff up the cushions in the base, an expanse of crÃ¨me patisserie that contrasts the berried tartness of the rose to perfection. A pleasure from top to toe, Rose Magnetic shows us what a perfumer can do with a few superb materials and the confidence to keep things simple."," Grapefruit, peppermint, Turkish rose absolute, rose extract, lychee, cedar, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mon Vetiver Eau de Parfum,1858,Essential Parfums," Mon Vetiver is a surprising and non-traditional vetiver, built on a series of contrasts between bright and dark, natural and synthetic, and modern and traditional, which serve to give this scent a truly distinctive character. Balancing its essentially serious character with the cheerful radiance of woody ambers, wearing Mon Vetiver feels like wearing a Savile Row suit with the lapels turned up. The structure of Mon Vetiver is very clever. It drapes a sparkling gin and tonic accord over a dark, woody fougÃ¨re-ish base for a play of light on dark that really grabs the attention. The rugged masculinity of vetiver is not hidden away or softened, but rather emphasized by the bitterness of lime and a fistful of pungent herbs - lavender and gentian. The play between natural and synthetic is perfectly pitched here too, the earthy sweetness of natural Indonesian patchouli illuminated and fluffed out by the sweet, musky glow of cashmeran. Woody, earthy, sweet, and expansive, this is a vetiver scent with both manners and swagger."," Haitian vetiver, gin accord, Mexican lime, juniper, lavender, gentian, cashmeran, Indonesian patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nice Bergamote Eau de Parfum,1507,Essential Parfums," Nice Bergamote is indeed a nice bergamot! In fact, we think the name might be underselling it a tad. The juicy sourness of the finest 100% natural Calabrian bergamot extract bursts out of the bottle like a firework, drenching the senses in an icy freshness that feels like liquid sunshine. What's remarkable here is that all the other supporting notes match the bergamot in its naturalness, so they fade in and out of the picture depending on their volatility, as if designed by Mother Nature herself.  For example, the soft eddy of natural jasmine and rose petals that swirls up in the heart creates a velvety thickness that steps in when the tartness of the topnote begins to fade. A buttery ylang licks at the edges, adding a fleshy sensuality to the brighter notes, but none of the flower's usual loudness. It's worth noting that the bergamot never disappears completely, only softening from a verdant, limey sourness to a thread of mandarin-like juiciness that runs through the scent, connecting all the parts. The base plays host to a natural tonka bean extract from Venezuela that smells like a golden cream of hay, almonds, and espresso with a shot of milk. The tonka bean accent is subtle, not overly sweet, and is further reined in by a smoky, resinous cedarwood. If you're looking for a natural-smelling bergamot scent that doesn't devolve into the usual white musks or woody ambers, then Nice Bergamot is more than just nice - it's perfect."," bergamot, Jasmine Grandiflora extract, natural cedarwood extract, ylang ylang, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
The Musc Eau de Parfum,2049,Essential Parfums," Every line needs a musk, and this is The Musc, a name that signposts both the brand's sense of humor and the specialness of the scent. Calice Becker said she imagined this scent“as a cloud of enveloping and comforting musk”, and that's a great way to describe its effect. Wearing The Musc is like stepping out of the freezing cold into a home filled with warmth and love.   The Musk operates in the narrow margins between hot and cold – it is fresh and spicy enough to keep you awake, but at the same time, so creamily warm that you'll feel like a cat stretching languorously in front of an open fire. Applied to warm skin, the initial one-two punch of freshly-crushed lavender and red ginger feels spicy and herbal all at once. But copious amounts of Laotian beeswax and Australian santalum album soak the aromatics in a sweet, honeyed creaminess as warming as a lamb's wool throw. These notes – both fresh and warm – are finally swept up into a cloud of whipped musks that wrap the wearer in a velvety cloud of scent. Nirvanolide and Serenolide, both elegantly fruity musks produced by Givaudan, are true to their name here, creating a serene, nirvana-esque fluffiness that's as clean as kitten fur."," Ginger, beeswax, lavender, sandalwood, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Mysterious Oud Extrait de Parfum,2283,Bortnikoff," The signature scent of the Bortnikoff house, Mysterious Oud is more than just another westernized agarwood creation- it's a wholly original creation that combines exquisite oud from all over the world (including renowned ""10k by Feel Oud"") to delight the senses and cast a deep spell of power and wisdom. Mysterious Oud greets the wearer with captivating notes of ambery citruses and ripe fruits- Bergamot and Orange spiced up with cardamom and then soaked in amber, sweet, rich, and romantic. It's the perfect introduction for a heart dominated by- no mystery here- oud, specifically a blend of beautiful, authentic oud oils supported by light, gentle and well-balanced floral note that bring out the ouds' resinous, spicy, and sweet nuances. From Thai and Vietnamese to Indian ouds, more layers are added to increase the depth of the aroma, balsamic, woody and vanillic. Some of the best oud you've ever smelled, in the service of a scent that thrillingly defies boring, ordinary oud-scent construction? This is the kind of mystery we could use more of."," Bergamot, cardamom, amber, orange, tea rose, jasmine, cinnamon, clove, myrrh, castoreum, pink pepper, nutmeg, tonka bean, oud, sandalwood, tolu balsam, opoponax, cedar, lotus, labdanum, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ombre Leather Eau de Parfum,1636,TOM FORD Signature," True luxury doesn't shout. If you've been on the hunt for the perfect leather but been either smothered by an avalanche of powdery florals or slapped around the face by a Cossack's oily winter boot, then breathe a sigh of relief because“your” leather has finally arrived. Wearing Ombre Leather is like slipping into a pair of the sleekest handmade leather Oxfords in the velvety hush of a store you have to ring a bell to get into.Enigmatically rich but dry, this is a leather that sings a song of pure, smooth luxury leather, with no excess powder, fruitiness, engine oil, or plasticky saffron to ruin your enjoyment. A touch of violet leaf adds a cool, watery greenness, but overall, this is not a translucent or vegetal leather. Like the ombre effect on a luxury leather jacket, this is a scent that bleeds one note into the next, building to a successively impressive effect – black leather over purple jasmine over earth-brown patchouli over green violets over white moss. As with all truly luxurious accessories, its most impressive feat is its balance – Ombre Leather may be objectively opulent, but even more so, it's undeniably among the most fabulously comfortable leather scents we've ever encountered."," Violet leaf, cardamom, jasmine sambac, black leather, white moss, patchouli Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Ombre Leather by TOM FORD Signature Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Imitation Man,1422,Amouage," One moment, one sensory experience, can completely alter a child's perception of the world. For Amouage Creative Director Christopher Chong, that moment happened the first time he experienced New York City as a child in the 1970's- the vibrant street culture, the breathtaking diversity, and the very sights, sounds and smells of the greatest city in the world during a tumultuous and consequential era threw open a door to life's infinite possibilities. Imitation is his attempt to capture that vibrancy. Imitation Man represents '70s NYC in bold, sensual, refined leather tones, opening with electric citrus and tingling spices that evoke blinding sunshine on bustling asphalt streets. The leather at the center of the fragrance is rich, soft suede, refined with lush rose, buttery orris and bright violet. An atmospheric base of spicy, smoky, animalic notes gives the thrilling authenticity of a smoke filled discotheque. Imitation Man will take you away to a time and place of chaos and beauty- and the endless adventures that follow."," Citron, nutmeg, black pepper, rose, orris, violet, myrrh, leather, vetiver, patchouli, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41892.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kazehikaru Eau de Parfum,2912,Di Ser," Japan's northenmost territory, Hokkaido is a land of rugged natural beauty, four-season weather, and pioneer spirit, where the winds blow strong and free. It's the scents carried on that wind that inspire Kazehikaru, the native flowers and trees of Hokkaido's rocky coastlines and towering, forest-covered mountains, a collection of flora that teems with vibrant, wild beauty- a distinctly Japanese combination of refinement and energy. Tart, energizing yuzu blends seamlessly with smooth neroli, while an evocative mix of shiso leaf and lavender provide distinctive, herbaceous sensuality against a backdrop of uniquely sweet Japanese rose and woodsy, green vetiver. Beautiful and untamed, Kazehikaru glows with the spirit of Hokkaido."," Yuzu, neroli, lavender, shiso, Japanese rose, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78807.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Zest Marin Eau de Parfum,2543,Fragrance du Bois," Anyone who's spend time wearing or smelling the unexpected summer hit Oud Vert Intense knows that Fragrance du Bois has a virtuosic adeptness with bright, fresh, complex fragrances. Well, Vert may need to slide over, as FdB's newest composition, Zest Marin, is every bit as lovely- the kind of eye-opening unisex that can and should be worn every single day between now and when the leaves change.   Like a day at the seaside, Zest Marin is crisp, effervescent, oceanic and fresh, with opening citrus tones of lemon and bergamot, perfectly complemented by the natural essence of galbanum. At the heart, lavandin and nutmeg bring out the best in each other in a partnership of delicious complexity, with vetiver, vanilla and woody musks providing irresistible base notes that simply make you want to plunge into the ocean of fragrance. If Fragrance du Bois gets any better at producing summer signatures, we may have to take a few months off."," Lemon, Bergamot, Galbanum.

Dent de Lait Eau de Parfum,1772,Serge Lutens," We often look back on milestone events from our childhood with great poignancy, recalling the feeling of innocence and wonder, and the moment that feeling begins to change. Dent de Lait is just that, a poignant celebration one of our earliest rights of passage during that most magical period of our lives. The loss of one's baby teeth serves as a metaphor for and a harbinger of the inevitable march toward adolescence, and this fragrance captures it with great aplomb. A flash of metallic zing opens bracingly, conjuring the slightly metallic flavor of the void where a baby tooth once roosted. The quick yet subtle bitterness slowly gives way to a creamy-soft and reassuring smoothness through the deft use of almond milk, coconut and floral aldehydes, transporting you to that moment just before you began to trade your innocence for wisdom.Creamy, smooth and ultimately reassuring, this gourmand is imbued with a sense of cloistered security, connecting us to that comforting feeling we enjoyed when we were young."," Almond milk, coconut, incense, heliotrope, slight metallic note.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36161.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cap Neroli Eau de Toilette,2690,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI," One of the most memorable aspects of the thoroughly gorgeous Cote d'Azur is the ubiquitous presence of orange trees, splashing the landscape with vivid color and perfuming the air with their beautiful scent. From a single tree, aromas of bright citrus, fresh woods, and smooth, creamy flowers float on the breeze, and when it comes to harvesting scented ingredients for perfumery, the versatility becomes astounding- one humble tree produces everything from bitter, spicy petitgrain to enchantingly smooth orange blossom absolute. Cap Neroli features every aspect of the Cote d'Azur's fabled orange trees, opening with a contrast of bitter petitgrain and sweet mandarin given a fresh aquatic shimmer via rosemary and mint. A heart of bright neroli and soft orange flower is enhanced with sweet ylang and fresh jasmine, all resting on a bed of fresh musks and oakmoss that linger for hours. It's a perfect tribute to a place of staggering beauty, and the ideal summer scent for just about anyone looking to bring a bit of the French Riviera with them wherever they go."," Petitgrain, orange, mandarin, rosemary, mint, neroli, ylang-ylang, jasmine, orange flower, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313058.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fougere d'Argent Eau de Parfum,1031,TOM FORD Private Blend," FougÃ¨re d'Argent is a bold reimagining of the classic fougÃ¨re, a structure that traditionally revolves around lavender, oakmoss, and coumarin. With oakmoss no longer available, Tom Ford has re-worked the model in a provocative manner, substituting moss with Akigalawood, a Givaudan captive derived from patchouli that has a wonderfully spicy, woodsy bitterness. What emerges from Ford's confident handling is a scent that smells truly masculine – earthy, herbaceous, and rich, with a radiantly spiced muskiness that billows around its wearer. If there's a scent that sums up everything that is great about old-school-meets-modern-cool masculine grooming, then it's probably FougÃ¨re d'Argent. The aromatic topnotes of lavender, ginger, and citrus notes give off a formal Savile Row vibe, with the sort of soapy, minty freshness one expects to emanate from a gentleman wearing an impeccably-tailored suit. Akigalawood stands in most competently for the traditional oakmoss, its spicy, mossy sharpness softened by the buttery labdanum amber tucked away into a corner. What marks out this fougere as a particularly modern twist on an old format is its use of coumarin. Whereas in traditional fougeres, the coumarin adds a dry hay-like grassiness, here the coumarin is taken in a sultrier, more oriental direction, emphasizing the musky sweetness of the tonka bean from whence the coumarin was extracted. Fans of aromatic lavender-tonka fragrances ranging from Gris Clair to Tom Ford's own Fucking Fabulous will likely love FougÃ¨re d'Argent for its bold updating of the fougere structure, but others appreciate it even more for its total lack of gourmandise. Dry, masculine, and admirably unsweet, FougÃ¨re d'Argent is for the man who effortlessly exudes confidence, no matter what he's wearing or doing."," mandarin, ginger, lavender, cistus, Akigalawood, coumarin Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Fougere d'Argent by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Live In Colors Eau de Parfum,2600,The House Of Oud," The perfect citrus is an elusive thing. Pretty much the Holy Grail of perfumery, in fact. Citrus notes are so volatile that the perfumer has to figure out how to keep them aloft and keep the scent smelling natural all the way through, a balancing act that's far harder than you might imagine. We're happy to report that Live in Colors pulls it off. It sparkles from top to bottom, without losing momentum along the way. In other words, this is the new summer freshie to beat.  The fizz of the opening is invigorating, with a burst of lemon and grapefruit so sharp you can taste it. It smells like an entire citrus tree pulped down and squeezed into the bottle, with everything from leaf to pulp and rind. The scent then deftly switches the charge to aromatics, running the juice over a bed of pink pepper and ginger root to keep those volatile citrus notes alive. There's a wonderful hot-cold effect going on in the background, the juicy sweetness of red fruit rubbing up against the coldness of spice. In the base, a soft, silvery hinoki wood supports the more aromatic notes but doesn't impose its own personality as insistently as cedar or gaiac. Live in Colors doesn't so much end as fade out gently, in a musky-woody trail that stays soft and clean. It's not a projection monster and it won't break any longevity records. But a citrus scent doesn't need to perform acrobatics to please us – it just needs to smell fresh and natural. And in that respect, Live in Colors scores a perfect 10."," Lemon, grapefruit, red fruits, ginger, pink pepper, musk, hinoki wood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Just Before Eau de Parfum,1194,The House Of Oud," Just Before revolves around Palo Santo, the so-called“Holy Wood” burned by the Incas and shamans to cleanse the spirit. The wood itself is sweetly fragrant with notes of pine, lemon, and mint, features the perfumers have cleverly chosen to accentuate with an equally bright trio of bergamot, lemon, and saffron, which melts effortlessly into the wood, leaving a film of orangey spice glittering on its pale, blond surface. It smells like citrus peel and cinnamon left to smolder on top of a freshly-lit piece of Palo Santo incense – smoky, but with a lively sparkle.  A rich, banana-ish ylang is a dollop of butter stirred into the cake, thickening the fragrance, and easing the woods and citruses into the spiced doughiness of benzoin. The contrast between the minty aromatics and the vanilla-sodden resins gives the scent an interesting bitter almond nuance that's not too far off the Hypnotic Poison model. But what really stands out here for us is the myrrh. Redolent of earth, wet stones, and anise, this ancient resin adds enormous depth, as well as a sepulchral darkness that contrasts the scent's more gourmand“patisserie” elements. Delicious and almost edible in its spicy warmth, Just Before teeters precariously between incense, amber, and woods. But because it never tips over into any one category, it remains interesting. Sugar and spice and all things nice....Just Before is a seductive siren call, calling out to us like the proverbial gingerbread cottage in the forest."," Bergamot, lemon, saffron, palo santo, ylang-ylang, myrrh, vanilla, benzoin, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76423.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
I Don't Know What Eau de Parfum,2104,D.S. and Durga," Among the first things aspiring perfumers learn is that the most important ingredients in the construction of a scent are the invisible ones- the aromachemicals and extremely subtle naturals that don't stand out to the nose, but nevertheless add crucial space, depth and structure to the fragrance. Even the finest floral extracts or precious woods depend on this structure to avoid feeling flattened-out, condensed or overpowering, but to the casual fragrance fan, the contributions of these delicate ""spacing"" notes goes completely unappreciated- until now. I Don't Know What is a minimalist scent in the compelling tradition of Escentric Molecules, able to be worn alone as a sheer, ethereal hint of citrus, musks and woods, but designed to layer beneath any scent you can imagine- fragrance oils, other perfumes, a favorite extract- boosting power, adding radiance, and generally enhancing absolutely anything it touches. We should all be so lucky!"," Bergamot essence, iso e super, vetiver acetate, civettone, firsantol, ambrox super",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68628.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

We'd find it hard to top Rehab, a sweet-yet-smoky stunner possessed of an almost primally compelling magnetism. The perfection lies in the sophisticated simplicity of the compostion- rich, sophisticated lavender and smoothly spiced tobacco set a vibrant yet refined tone, masculine-leaning but drop-dead sexy on just about anybody. As Rehab dries, smoky, creamy patchouli and vanilla create a warmly ambered aura that lingers for hours. We can't tell you how to use the dangerously seductive power at your fingertips- but you've been warned."," Bergamot, lavender, tobacco, cedar, patchouli, gaiac, sandalwood, vanilla, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/802000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Blessed Baraka Eau de Parfum,1584,Initio Parfums," Absolutely captivating, Blessed Baraka weaves a blend of musks, woods and rich amber around the wearer to create a palpable sense of divine energy that instantly commands the room.

Grev Extrait de Parfum,1664,Slumberhouse," Slumberhouse simply does not produce ordinary, standard scents- something absolutely necessary to keep in mind when describing Grev. Is it a fougere? Sure, the definition might roughly fit, but leave your expectations of unchallenging freshness aside. What it really is, is a transparent metallic/herbal accord of star anise, crisp apple peel, spearmint leaf, ocean pine and bergamot twisted into hollowed tunnels padded in turquoise hues, dusted in sweet mossy mineral powder and blanketed with copaiba resin and sandalwood oil. Ordinary left the building a long time ago."," Copaiba balsam, spearmint, pine, star anise, apple peel, fir resin, clove, orris root, cedar, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/631012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Crepuscule des Ames Eau de Parfum,1048,Atelier des Ors," Crepuscule refers to the moments of transition from light to darkness, and from dark to light.

A second skin to wear in the dusky house while the souls are at play, when we feel deep desires and the duality inherent in our consciousness.

Gold Incense Eau de Parfum,1498,Mancera," Some incense fragrances are quiet and spiritual, while others are sultry and seductive. But when was the last time you experienced an incense fragrance that was lush, floral and opulent? Introducing Gold Incense, a seductively exuberant, downright juicy floral incense that hums with light, life and happiness. By blending ripe, fruity mandarin with luscious rose, the rich vein of incense running through the center of Gold Incense is never dry or austere, but rather compellingly robust, playing off of spice-forward notes of coffee and pink pepper and smooth, rich patchouli and sandalwood to create an enveloping, three-dimensional composition. Maybe not everything that glitters is gold- but this stunningly robust, romantic take on incense could be nothing else."," Incense, pink pepper, mandarin, bergamot, coffee, violet, rose, jasmine, patchouli, sandalwood, benzoin, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64936.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hindu Kush Eau de Parfum,2722,Mancera," Rugged, imposing, and central to military history both ancient and modern, the Hindu Kush mountain range in Central Asia is a formidable sight indeed. It's a border not merely between Pakistan and Afghanistan, but between heaven and earth itself. To honor this wild location, Mancera presents a uniquely resinous scent, rich with spice and incense, perfect for the adventurous spirit in all of us. Hindu Kush opens with a sweet and complex layer of exotic spice, with prominent notes of saffron and clove reinforced with the energy of black pepper and the earthy resinousness of another famed export of the region- a cannabis essential oil harvested from authentic Afghan-grown plants. Oud, patchouli and woods dominate the heart, but their heaviest and darkest tones are played down, keeping the robust spiciness at the center of the composition. A vanilla and musk base works along the same concept, reinforcing the resins and spices without drowning them in overly rich or earthy tones and presenting Hindu Kush as that rarest of oriental fragrances- one with more subtlety than opulence. And as a result, it's hard to think of a human being alive that wouldn't smell unbelievable wearing it."," Saffron, cumin, cloves, black pepper, labdanum, davana, cannabis, agarwood, patchouli, sandalwood, cedarwood, amber, white musk, gaiac, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64933.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

With well above average projection and longevity, Wild Python will spend hours curling itself around you, its power on full display. How you choose to use it is up to you."," Tuberose, osmanthus, peach, bergamot, jasmine, orange blossom, patchouli, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64934.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hyrax Extrait de Parfum,1262,Zoologist," Climbing to its perch in the morning sky, the African sun reaches across a mountain range to caress a wide, flat boulder, baking it to a gentle heat. From the shade of a narrow crevice, a family of hyrax emerges, hot dust dulling the sheen of their golden fur. They settle onto the warm expanse of rock to partake in their ritual sunbath, but remain ever vigilant. The shadow of a soaring eagle rushes across the ground. With an urgent squeal, the alarm is sounded - the colony dashes for cover. As the heat from sweltering sun intensifies, ancient aromas are coaxed from the scorched rocks, sparse vegetation and petrified hyraceum. Eerily, they intertwine to form a scent that is both primitive and exotic, its animalistic tendencies tamed by an undercurrent of sweet florals.At the heart of Zoologist Hyrax is a daring, seldom-used ingredient in the art of perfumery –– African stone, or hyraceum, giving this bold animalic scent its distinctive signature. This unique perfume skillfully blends saffron, pink pepper, whiskey, rose and musks to invoke an abstract image of a dusty African mountainscape. Like the nimble hyraxes that spill from hillside crevices in search of the sun upon their musky hides, this scent will weave its way into your senses with a light but primal touch."," Blackberry, elemi, pink pepper, saffron, Turkish rose, African Stone, hyacinth, styrax, whiskey, amber, benzoin, musks, patchouli, sandalwood, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76019.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bois Dore Eau de Parfum,1083,Van Cleef & Arpels," Fine fragrance has a stunning ability to represent myth and poetry in vivid reality- to make the conceptual come to olfactive life. In Bois Dore, Fabrice Pellegrin envisions a fantastical Golden Wood, glowing with rich woods, delectable spice and smooth tonka bean. While the core of the scent is undeniably the interplay between the velvety, robust wood notes and a powdered, vanilla-inflected tonka bean, the beauty of Bois Dore manifests itself in its remarkable versatility- fans of Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille and Penhaligon's Roaring Radcliff will find that a supporting note of tobacco imbues a familiar strain of regal, masculine texture, while the powderiness of the tonka and a distinctly sweet almond maintain a warm, feminine sensuality. And no matter your persuasions, a long-lasting tingle of black pepper and a salty mineralic note provide a unique and energizing sparkle. While not every fragrance lives up to its concept, we're thrilled to report that Bois Dore is every bit the luminous, fantastical Golden Wood we were promised."," Black pepper, mineral notes, cedar, vanilla, tobacco, almond, tonka, musk, teak",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50210.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Pikovaya Dama Eau de Parfum,1172,Xerjoff," A celebration of the Golden Era of Russian literature, Pikovaya Dama ""Queen of Spades"", named for the famed Pushkin story, is a glamorously vintage, unapologetically opulent emissary from bygone glory days. Blending sharp, vibrant citrus with a richly, unabashedly powdered romantic floral heart, atop a sensual base of musks, woods and vanillas. But in reality, describing the individual notes feels incomplete somehow, as the real achievement of Pikovaya Dama is a sumptuously blended, wholly pervasive atmosphere of vintage grandeur, where the pillow-soft powder, luscious florals and deep musky base all exist simultaneously, exuding a soulfully resonant aura that only strengthens as it wears. Extravagant, beautiful and unique- Pikovaya Dama is a rare treasure indeed."," Bergamot, lemon, rose, neroli, coriander, atlas cedar, orris, incense, nutmeg, patchouli, sandalwood, musk, bourbon vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51148.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Intense Eau de Parfum,1633,Fragrance du Bois," The oriental, reinvented. When Fragrance du Bois set their sights on amber as a main component for their newest Prive release, our expectations- and imaginations- were sky high. After all, the Prive line is defined by exceedingly rare ingredients, including their proprietary 100% organic vintage oud, as well as a willingness to simultaneously embrace and defy convention, to deliver scents that knew when to follow traditional structure, and when to take bold risks. To that end, Amber Intense is certainly an amber scent- loaded with rich, resinous, balsamic fullness- but with its spicy, floral complexity, it's also so much more. Amber Intense opens with a spice and citrus laden burst, where notes of bergamot, tangerine, black pepper and cinnamon pop and fizz with vibrant energy. As the rich floral heart unfolds, an exquisite blend of rose, jasmine and neroli captives against the rich amber accord, a warmly resinous blend of styrax, labdanum and patchouli that doubles down with enduring base notes of benzoin and peru balsam alongside Fragrance du Bois' unparalleled vintage oud. The result is a scent that's rich but never heavy, complex but never confusing, with an undeniably confident elegance. Whether you approach Amber Intense from the perspective of an amber lover or that of a connoisseur of spicy orientals, you're sure to find your new signature scent."," Bergamot, tangerine, orange, black pepper, cinnamon, cumin, saffron, neroli, rose, jasmine, blackcurrant, patchouli, styrax, cistus, benzoin, peru balsam, musk, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75723.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Moth Extrait de Parfum,1167,Zoologist," Their days are spent secluded in camouflage, the intricate pattern of their wings disguising them against a coarse backdrop of barks and rocks. When they finally stir, even their flight is concealed, shrouded beneath the cover of night. Moonlight ripples off a delicate coating of tiny hairs as their feathered antennae guide them in their search for a mate. Only one temptation can lure them from their quest. Should they succumb to the attraction of the flame, their urge to procreate may be quashed in a wisp of smoke and a smattering of ashes. At first encounter, the rich, gothic scent of Zoologist Moth may surprise but soon it hypnotizes. A heavy dose of dark spices jolts your senses before settling into a dusting of honey-sweet rose and dark, inky florals. Slowly, it tests its wings, taking flight on an exotic journey of nagarmotha, guaiac wood and patchouli. Beneath it all lingers a smoky undertone that serves as a constant reminder of the danger within the tantalizing flame."," Black pepper, cinnamon, clove, cumin, lemon, nutmeg, saffron, heliotrope, iris, jasmine, mimosa, muguet, rose, ambergris, honey, resins, gaiac, musk, nagarmotha, oud, patchouli, smoke, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76018.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Unsettled Eau de Parfum,2616,Bruno Fazzolari," Since when does the end of the world smell so pleasant? It's a fair question if your first exposure to Unsettled was the hand-blown flacon originally commissioned by the Nevada Museum of Art: an atomic blast shaped container that literally glowed green from the uranium glass used to craft it. So it's something of a surprise that the scent itself is downright happy- a fresh, creamy sandalwood brightened even more with mouthwatering pineapple and smooth black tea. The result is a wonderfully unisex sandalwood scent that feels like a day on the beach- smooth, easy to wear, and almost hypnotically relaxing. It's the kind of fragrance that would make an effortless signature- it's hard to imagine a circumstance or person it wouldn't smell amazing on. It's Bruno's clever way of juxtaposing the occasionally- but consequentially- overlapping histories of Nevada and the South Pacific. No, your bottle won't be made of uranium glass- we're pretty sure that wouldn't be a big hit with our shippers- but one spritz and you won't be worried about a thing."," Bergamot, china black tea, clary sage, pineapple, caledonian sandalwood, labdanum, vanilla, ocean breezes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69311.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Viper Green Eau de Parfum,1837,Ex Nihilo," There's something inherently dangerous about green scents. Yes, they're fresh and vibrant, but lurking behind that freshness is a sense of wildness, of instinctual, uncontrollable nature. This dangerous, seductive side of green is what gives us Viper Green, a new unisex floral from Ex Nihilo that feels thrillingly, poisonously sexy. Opening with a flash of bright green mandarin backed up with crisp angelica and bitingly fresh galbanum, we can tell from the very start that this is really and truly a green scent, thorns and all. A floral heart of iris adds dry, cool elegance, while spiky vetiver and deep, earthy patchouli are rich and imposing with primordial power. To wear Viper Green is to feel like a hunter, imbued with predatory grace, fully in tune with nature. Make sure you pack it for your next hunt."," Green mandarin, angelica, galbanum, iris, vetiver, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Eau de Cologne,1316,Les Bains Guerbois," A fiery, subversive, take-no-prisoners interpretation of the classic formula, Les Bains Guerbois EDC is no ordinary eau de cologne. Eschewing the familiarity of a citrus top, this EDC opens with a sensuously spicy mix of ginger and cardamom, igniting the senses before leading into a rich, woodsy heart of cedar and patchouli balanced against a smooth, mystical papyrus. The base is no less captivating, as sweet musk and warm amber intertwine with smoky, sacred frankincense for an eau de cologne of unparalleled depth and sophistication. Invigorating and seductive, this unique eau de cologne is the perfect scent for the boldly adventurous, the cheekily controversial, and anyone looking to break out from the monotony of the mainstream."," Ginger, cardamom, patchouli, cedar, papyrus, musk, amber, frankincense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1885 Bains Sulfureux Eau de Parfum,1887,Les Bains Guerbois," While the legendary Bains Guerbois has undergone many transformations in its 133 years of life, it began as a temple of beauty and well-being, a renowned spa and bathhouse that played host to Belle Epoque luminaries from Renoir to Proust. 1885 Bains Sulfureux is an evocation of those early glory days, when an open door would release the aromas of thousands of essences of plants, herbs and flowers, carried on the warm steam of those legendary Turkish and Russian baths. After opening with invigorating top notes of juicy mandarin and bergamot, alongside herbaceous rosemary and blackcurrant leaf, a fresh floral heart of orange blossom and jasmine feels as soothingly lush as an infused soaking tub. And a complex, never heavy base of therapeutic essences including tonka, tolu, benzoin and incense enchant and delight, healing the spirit and empowering the body. Refreshing, romantic and complex, 1885 is a magical journey through time and space."," Bergamot, rosemary, blackcurrant, mandarin, orange blossom, jasmine, tolu balsam, benzoin, cashmere wood, incense, tonka, sandalwood, labdanum, patchouli, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
1978 Les Bains Douches Eau de Parfum,1750,Les Bains Guerbois," Paris, 1978- a legendary spa has evolved into one of the world's wildest nightclubs, and you have exclusive access. Your endless night begins in a joyful haze of noise, liquor and laughter- the signature bitter orange of a negroni for your date, and a whiskey infused with clary sage for you- boozy, bright and aromatic.

On the dance floor, the exotic gyrations of thousands of beautiful people recall rich, seductive tones of myrrh, vanilla, and patchouli- the Bains Douches is but another waypoint in time and space connected to the revelries of bygone eras, and those yet to come.

2013 Residence d'Artistes Eau de Parfum,1674,Les Bains Guerbois," For a brief moment before it was transformed into a boutique luxury hotel, the Les Bains space was given a unique form of rehabilitation- Paris' most accomplished and admired street artists were moved in to live there for several weeks, with the freedom to pursue whatever artistic goals they desired. This spiritual cleansing is commemorated with 2013 Residence d'Artistes, a beautifully fruity, woodsy, and floral scent that explodes with color and inspiration. Juicy peach and mandarin collide with lush violet and jasmine, mouthwatering cumin and cardamom, all against a backdrop of warm, musky leather. Like the short but amazing moment in the grand history of Les Bains that inspired it, this is an ode to creativity- the spontaneity, the serendipity, and ultimately, the memory that lingers in the aftermath."," Cardamom, mandarin, bergamot, peach, jasmine, papyrus, violet, cumin, musk, sandalwood, patchouli, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
2015 Le Phenix Eau de Parfum,1884,Les Bains Guerbois," ""In Paris, nothing disappears, and everything can come back to life.""It's with this sentiment that the legendary Les Bains once again steps out onto the scene. Having lived as a beloved spa and gathering house, then a world-famous party spot, then a luminary artists' retreat, its newest incarnation is a fusion of them all- a boutique hotel, a spa, a club, a waypoint. The full history of this magical locale is laid out in Le Phenix, with the rich scent of a majestic firebird rising from old ashes- fiery ginger and cardamom set the scene, while a smooth cedarwood heart projects strength, integrity, and tradition. Most of all, a bright, rich incense permeates throughout the fragrance, exuding ethereal beauty, timeless power, and warm spirituality. When you wear Le Phenix, you look forwards and backwards simultaneously, reverent towards the history of this grand place, but charging forwards in pursuit of new adventure and achievement. Le Phenix is a scent for those in perfect harmony with the eternal pleasures and rewards of the City of Light."," Ginger, cardamom, patchouli, cedar, papyrus, incense, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/797004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Gelsomini di Capri Eau de Parfum,1547,Carthusia," As is customary in the tradition of Carthusia  Gelsomini's beginnings originate from a legend which tells of Carthusians. Its origins come from kings and and queens, but above all, from flowers, the most beautiful in Capri.  Among these are delicate jasmine which, as if by magic, evoke the charm of a unique island in the bouquet of its new fragrance. Delicate sweet fruity notes are brought together in an intriguing fragrance which is fresh but persistent. Jasmine and Egyptian geranium combine with clove and ylang while the intoxicating cedar and zagara climax into the musky amber notes of bees wax and Madagascar Vanilla. One of a kind and only from Capri."," Jasmine, geranium, cloves,  ylang-ylang, orange blossom, cedar, beeswax, Turkish rose, Madagascar vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52920.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lavish Parfum,1597,Boadicea the Victorious," A clean and fresh stunner with the typical sense of excitement and attitude that one has come to expect from Boadicea the Victorious. Uplifting and buoyant from the beginning. Bergamot dashed with lemon gives a sense of hope and expectation. The heart is bright and optimistic, orange flower meeting with decadent rose, peppered delightfully with nutmeg. The base is warm, yet soft, and full of rapturous joy."," Bergamot, lemon, orange flower, rose, pepper, nutmeg, sandalwood, cedar, patchouli, gaiac, vetiver, moss, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48535.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hallucinogenic Pearl Eau de Parfum,2833,A Lab on Fire," While no serious fragrance enthusiast would ever question the luxuriousness of orris butter- the rich, earthy-creamy depth, the papyrus-like smoothness- it's fair to ask a simpler question: is it any fun? Alas, such sophistication sometimes comes at a cost, which is often freshness, light, or spontaneity. Perhaps that's why we love Hallucinogenic Pearl so much- preternaturally light-on-its-feet, it's an orris-based stunner that deploys fresh musks and smooth leather to conjure up a higher, happier plane of existence where orris is not only sophisticated, but sparkling. Awash in vintage radiance, we feel warmth, light, and deeply sexy leather smoothness all flowing together, so comforting and seductive that it's no effort at all to surrender to its power and slip into the cosmic groove."," Ambrette, bergamot, pink pepper, violet, orris, iriseine, suede, blonde woods, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56717.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fior Fiore Eau de Parfum,2920,Eau d'Italie," The iconic image of the Hotel Le Sirenuse, the inspiration behind Eau d'Italie, is from the outside- who could forget the gorgeous cliffs and sparkling blue water of the Amalfi Coast? But the man-made elements of the hotel are every bit as magical- case in point, the grand, dreamlike Champagne Bar, which winds from beautifully contoured interior out onto an enchanting terrace replete with charming mosaic work and a variety of night-blooming jasmine plants, who release their intoxicating scent into the warm evening air, creamy, fresh and seductive. This is the inspiration behind Fior Fiore, summer nights on the terrace, surrounded by flowers, the day's sun a faint glow beyond the horizon. Lush lily of the valley intertwines with a gentle but deeply romantic jasmine, all supported with a fresh, comforting ambrette musk. It's a beautiful memory, hazy and candlelit, tipsy on champagne and warmly sensual, a taste of Positano evenings you can take home with you all year round."," Lily of the valley, jasmine petals, jasmin sambac, ambrette.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/43235.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Terra Mia Eau de Parfum,1380,Carthusia," Carthusia has long held a well-earned reputation for their ability to capture the olfactory beauty of the Italian landscape- azure sea, juicy citrus, wild aromatic vegetation, and shining sun. But Terra Mia, a rare Carthusia gourmand, seems more inspired by the simple joys of traditional Italian life and culture- gatherings in the village square, puppet shows, fresh flowers in the market, and steaming cups of espresso. So while it opens with wonderful freshness- tart bergamot, bright pink pepper- the grand players here are warmer, deeper notes- mouthwatering hazelnut, sweet orange blossom, lush rose, and robust coffee, all set against a resinously ambered wood base both rich and soothing. As with all Carthusia scents, we feel transported, but this time we're in an ancient piazza full of life and laughter, an espresso in hand, joy in our hearts. We might not have grown up in Italy, but one sniff of Terra Mia and you'll agree- it feels like home."," Bergamot, neroli, pink pepper, rose, jasmine, coffee, hazelnut, orange blossom, vanilla, amber woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52919.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Nudiflorum Extrait de Parfum,1051,Nasomatto," Natural. Primitive. Sensual. These are the words that Nasomatto chooses to provide, instead of a notes list, to represent Nudiflorum. One sniff and you'll see why any notes would ultimately feel inadequate- of course, it's driven by florals as the name might suggest, but these are bold, impressionistic, and shockingly intimate florals- brighter, lusher and more vivid than a straight-up reproduction, with a compellingly skinlike musk surrounding them, at times innocent and youthful, at others carnal, animalic and deeply seductive, eventually gaining a smoky and woodsy edge with which Nasomatto fans will be well acquainted. It's olfactory intimacy, the kind of scent you must experience to understand its raw power and seductive tranquility. Most simply put, Nudiflorum is the kind of sensual fragrance that only Nasomatto could ever produce.",,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Erawan Eau de Parfum,2827,Dusita," Erawan is the scent of late summer tipping into fall. It is the smell of the harvest, with fields of aromatic barley, hay, and oats waiting to be brought in, the earthy goodness of nuts, flour, and honey stacked high in the larder, and the wholesome, leaf-brownness of tobacco leaves drying on barn floors. It is not an uncommon theme in indie perfumery, but Erawan stands proud of other examples by way of two things. First, Dusita's sophisticated style of making perfumes puts a high-definition gloss on the rustic theme, making it the perfect choice for a young Paris or New York sophisticate who wants real, but who also wants polished. Second, whereas most fragrances with a countryside bent are loaded with syrupy sweetness, booze, or fruit, Erawan boasts only the gentle sweetness of nuts, hay, and herbs, thus making it an airy, elegant wear. A series of little contrasts has been cleverly worked into the composition to give the scent texture and movement. There is the herbal brightness of clary sage and petigrain up top, but also a nutty, creamy undercurrent of vetiver to provide depth. Liatris, or deertongue, a plant extract that lends perfumes a coumarin-like tone, gives off the scent of freshly-toasted tobacco leaf, but its dry resinousness is nicely offset by the damp, fresh greenery of a surprising muguet note planted in the center. The inky bitterness of oakmoss is suggestive of long shadows under oak trees, but a judicious dose of vanilla softens everything into a delicious, late-afternoon blur. Erawan wears like a ray of sunshine on your face. Both beautiful and unusual, its rustic charm does not come at the cost of sophistication."," herbal notes, petitgrain, lily-of-the-valley, Haitian vetiver, hay, clary sage, liatris (deertongue), cedar, oakmoss, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fleur de Lalita Eau de Parfum,2099,Dusita," Fleur de Lalita is a bouquet of tropical flowers that has grown up, moved to France, and taken up smoking and reading Baudelaire. Peel back the layers and you'll see that its core of lush ylang ylang, tropical lilies, and magnolia remains intact. But bookended by a smoky galbanum up top and salty, lived-in ambergris down below, Fleur de Lalita is definitely a floral for adults. The playoff between milky sweetness of tropical flowers and the smoky, salty galbanum-ambergris tandem is what makes Fleur de Lalita such a tour de force. The innocent side of Fleur de Lalita shows its face first, with a cluster of jasmine, magnolia, and lily so wet and crisp it might have been cut from the garden just moments before. Curlicues of buttery ylang ylang snake around the white petals as you bury your face in this bouquet, releasing a steamy tropical undercurrent. But the damp lushness of the flowers is almost immediately cut by a waft of galbanum, a green resin whose smell is pitched halfway between freshly-cut plant stems and smoke. The effect is of being in a tropical garden while someone is smoking an illicit cigarette in a nearby ylang bush, the smoke mingling gently with the creamy flowers. A dash of resinous sandalwood gives the florals and greenery a handsome backbone. But the real payoff comes in the base, when musky ambrette wraps around natural ambergris to form a sweet and salty skin-like nuance that will send you over the top. The combination of creamy florals, crisp greenery, smoke, and salty musks in Fleur de Lalita is simply stunning. This is the fragrance that will make you feel like the best version of yourself, every day of your life."," Rose de mai, magnolia, jasmine, white lily, galbanum, ylang ylang, ambrette, vanilla, sandalwood, tonka bean, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Moscow Mule Eau de Parfum,1446,Juliette Has a Gun," Crisp, potent and energizing- a Moscow Mule, that electric combination of premium vodka, fresh lime, and fiery ginger beer, served in an ice-cold copper mug, might just be the perfect summer refreshment. It's only appropriate that this simple, perfect formula is the inspiration for the latest from Romano Ricci and Juliette Has A Gun, a house that's always excelled at finding the complexity in minimalism. And what a knockout Moscow Mule is- blending bright, tart bergamot with a wonderfully spicy ginger note for an intoxicating kick from the very first sniff. In the background, a subtly powerful base of Norlimbanol- a Firmenich molecule known for dry woodsiness and a sexy hint of animalic amber- ensures rich longevity without sacrificing an ounce of freshness. Is Moscow Mule a simple scent? Absolutely. But in that simplicity is a stunning- and wonderfully easy to wear- cocktail perfect for literally any occasion. Sidle up to the bar and order yourself a Moscow Mule- who knows where your night will take you?"," Bergamot, ginger, woody notes (norlimbanol)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40131.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fantastic Oud Eau de Parfum,1105,Montale," What is the true identity of oud? While the ingredient can have many characteristics- sharp, rich, warm, medicinal, pungent, spicy- it's true nature transcends specific notes and becomes something more alluringly abstract- a sense of mystery, exoticism, romance and supernatural presence. This is at the core of Fantastic Oud, in many ways a culmination of Montale's illustrious work with the material, a sumptuous feast for the senses. This rich, nuanced and warm fragrance reveals notes of rose, patchouli, tobacco, incense and styrax that merge with the voluptuous notes of leather, sandalwood and ambergris revealing the rawest character of oud. In other words, it's every facet of oud, masterfully blended together to offer something for everyone in a hypnotically smooth, spicy, rich, warm, fresh, lush, seductive package. Whether you're a newcomer to Montale's ouds or you own them all, you're sure to fall in love with Fantastic Oud."," Incense, styrax, tobacco, oud, rose, patchouli, leather, sandalwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Orris Tattoo Eau de Parfum,1572,Parle Moi de Parfum," Orris Tattoo pays tribute to one of perfumery's most incredible raw materials – orris root. While florists adore the delicate, arching flowers and tall green stems of the iris, perfumers are far more interested in the unprepossessing-looking root underneath. The process of making orris butter is a real labor of love. The iris roots, or rhizomes as they are known, are left to grow underground for three years, and then left to dry out in a cool storeroom for another three years. The result is the most expensive butter you will never find on any supermarket shelf – a silvery substance that Chandler Burr once referred to as“liquid good taste”. Like pure orris butter itself, Orris Tattoo smells like the ground and the sky all bound together in one smell. To wit, it smells like bread, violets, eau de vie, suede shoes, cold air, and silky earth. Rooty and somewhat fresh at fresh, the scent soon develops a putty-like texture that remains cool to the touch, like chilled butter taken from a florist's fridge. The orris here feels very pure, but it won't make you feel like you're chomping on raw carrots – its purity is gentle, wrapped in a cashmere blanket. This purity is sustained right through to the supple grey suede that develops in the lower registers of the scent. With a material as exquisite as orris root, we pleased to see that Orris Tattoo resists the temptation to add on too many bells and whistles – apart from a touch of what feels like humid, coconutty sandalwood, cashmere woods, and a hint of violets or heliotrope, this fragrance never really deviates from the orris root hymn sheet. So, if you're looking for the doughy but ethereal pleasures of pure orris, then put Orris Tattoo on your test list stat.", Orris root,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76709.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Chypre Mojo Eau de Parfum,2098,Parle Moi de Parfum," In 1917, there was a new shape in the air when Coty launched its now legendary Chypre de Coty. Putting forth the idea that a perfume could smell as indefinably complex as the person who wore it, this landmark scent swept away the cobwebs of the simpler floral perfumery of the previous century. In the century that followed, the chypre idea proved to be an enduring one, its seemingly endless permutations of bergamot, labdanum, and oakmoss giving rise to some of the most meaningful perfumes in the world, like Mitsouko, Tabac Blond, and Pour Monsieur. Of course, time stops for no man (and no chypre). In this post-IFRA age, and 100 years on from the launch of Chypre de Coty, Parle-Moi de Parfum suggests that Chypre Mojo is what a chypre now looks like. Despite the absence of oakmoss, Chypre Mojo rolls in with all the presence of a proper“old skool” perfume. Its combination of carnation and patchouli conjures up a phantasmagoric impression of a massive rose-patch chypre that's been soaked in plum wine and dusted with black pepper. A bright, pulpy heart of mango takes the stiff bones of the chypre and ages it backwards until it feels more legible for a younger audience. Chypre Mojo never feels less than a chypre, though. While the fruit keeps those feel-good endorphins flowing, the peppery carnation and patchouli duo adds that touch of vermouth dryness that says chypre as clear as a bell. Confident, modern, and ebullient, Chypre Mojo makes us think that, 100 years on, the chypre still has its mojo."," Bergamot, carnation, mango, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76710.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Heritage Eau de Parfum,2096,Fragrance du Bois," Many fragrances offer you a journey to a faraway destination, but Heritage is a journey back in time, to an era when European high society was bold, beautiful and sumptuously opulent- and the fragrances were every bit up to that standard. Truly a haute couture scent, Heritage is an elegant, alluring potion that evokes grand ballrooms and ornate theaters- a true taste of the kind of luxury that too often has been sadly confined to a bygone age. Heritage opens with vintage panache, featuring fresh, invigorating notes of juicy bergamot and a bright twinkle of sparkling, ethereal aldehydes. A complex, yet approachable, heart of sweet jasmine and powdery orris is elevated with a touch of mystical frankincense, while in the rich, dignified base, a warm blend of woods, creamy vanilla, and superlative natural oud provide remarkable depth. Taken as a whole, this is the kind of opulence that prefers to pamper rather than overwhelm- it's genuinely comforting, conferring an almost hypnotic sense of well-being on the wearer. Sure, we'll never get to live in Paris as it was in the Belle Epoque, but with Heritage, we can visit- and what a glamorous visit it will be."," Bergamot, aldehydes, jasmine, orris, frankincense, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, pure organic vintage oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75722.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Vanille Benjoin Eau de Parfum,2559,Affinessence Paris," Upon application, Vanille Benjoin immediately envelops its wearer in a soft, protective cocoon of vanilla that we find insanely comforting. It's a hug in a bottle. The perfumer, an island native herself, helped the brand to source two types of very special vanilla for this scent – the first, a soft, floral Tahitian vanilla, and the second, a resinous Madagascaran vanilla. The vanillas add a toasty warmth to the scent, as well as a delicious“roundness”, but it's worth noting that there's nothing sugary or heavy about Vanille Benjoin. The vanilla here is dry and woody, tending towards the savory end of the spectrum rather than the sweet.The salty diffusiveness of ambroxan certainly helps to control sweetness, but the main hand in ensuring the scent remains dry is the Siam benzoin, the basenote material chosen here to be“married” to the vanilla. Although benzoin is roughly analogous to vanilla in that they both add a warm, sweet“fullness” to the basenotes of a scent, benzoin differs substantially by being far more medicinal, resinous, and spicy-peppery in character. In Vanille Benjoin, the fiery cinnamon topnotes of benzoin are cleverly matched, step for step, by cedarwood, a material possessed of a similarly spicy, balsamic underbite. In an equally smart move, the doughy, clay-like properties of benzoin are drawn out by a judicious application of tonka bean absolute, which shares with benzoin a buttery texture and nutty aftertaste. Vanille Benjoin resolves itself in a delicious vanilla suede accord that signals pure luxury and comfort, without any of attendant stodge - powdered sugar diffused in the crisp, cold air of a winter's morning."," Tahitian vanilla absolute, Madagascan vanilla absolute, Siamese benzoin, tonka, ambroxan, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Santal Basmati Eau de Parfum,1738,Affinessence Paris," The deeply fragrant aroma of Basmati rice is one of the best smells in the world, and frankly, we're a little surprised it doesn't turn up in more perfumes. In Santal Basmati, perfumer Alexandra Carlin, taking her cue from founder Sophie Broneau's passion for basenotes, cleverly pairs the scent of cooked rice to the most precious and fragrant of woods: Mysore sandalwood (s. album), grown sustainably in Kerala. Why clever? Well, you'll notice that basmati rice has a lot in common with sandalwood – they share a certain creaminess, as well as a steamy, nutty undertone akin to grains toasted in butter and cooked long and slow in milk. Santal Basmati simply identifies the facets they have in common, unites them, and serves us up a bowl of pure bliss. You'd be forgiven for thinking that, given all these milky, woody notes, Santal Basmati is a rather heavy concoction – but it's really not. A remarkable sleight of hand injects the composition with an airiness that ensures that, while certainly comforting and warming, the scent wears as lightly as a silk cardigan. The sweetness level is nicely judged too, with a buttered popcorn nuance adding a hint of salt, and a supporting framework of woods that stops the scent tipping over completely into rice pudding territory. If you love the triple crÃ¨me comfort factor of woody gourmands such as Santal Majuscule (Serge Lutens), Palo Santo (Carner Barcelona), or PralinÃ© de Santal (Pierre Guillaume), then let us tell you straight: you need some Santal Basmati in your life."," Mysore sandalwood, basmati rice, patchouli, iris, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cedre Iris Eau de Parfum,1331,Affinessence Paris," Cedre Iris is that rare bird – a 100% equal partnership between delicate iris pallida and a material that would normally eat it for breakfast, namely a tough, resinous cedarwood. Well, three types of cedarwood, to be exact, the combination of which gives the composition a complex woody profile that darts between smoky, leathery, balsamic, and spicy. But in Cedre Iris, the tension between the heavy cedarwood and the ephemeral orris is held tight, allowing the cool, waxen orris to float serenely over the very material that would normally subsume it. The payoff of this impressive balancing act is a fragrance that highlights both the exquisitely powdery sheen of iris and the spicy thickness of cedar. Iris pallida from Florence, which costs $60,000 per kilo, has been used in significant quantities here, so you really feel its presence. But Iris Cedre is not a monolith. The iris and cedarwood star, for sure, but in time, you will notice that they are supported by elements that cast their own shadows. Particularly noticeable is the cinnamon-dusted benzoin that sands down the cedar and orris into a soft blur of incensey, vanillic powder, for dramatic scent trail that's sure to turn heads. But myrrh also plays a significant role here, lending the drydown in particular a crepuscular, almost fungal earthiness that serves to highlight the pale dustiness of the iris. Wax, butter, silver, earth, incense, and polished woods – Iris Cedre truly is the last word in tailored elegance."," Cedar (Moroccan Atlas, Texas, Virginia), Florentine iris absolute, benzoin, myrrh, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Patchouli Oud Eau de Parfum,1001,Affinessence Paris," Tom Waits' voice was once memorably described by a music critic as sounding as if ""it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months, and then taken outside and run over with a car"" – and Patchouli Oud by perfumer Nicolas Bonneville has much the same quality. Earthy, tannic, and soaked in mysterious essences wrenched from trees in the depths of Indonesian and Javan jungles, Patchouli Oud is a study in brown. Many oud-based fragrances smell pungent and oily, but Patchouli Oud plumps for a dry, almost herbal take on its subject matter, for a result that runs surprisingly close to the clipped elegance of vintage powerhouse masculines. The oud, medicinal and slightly dirty, is first out of the gate, quickly followed by a dusty 100% cocoa patchouli that seems to invert all light, drawing us deeper into its shadows. As with any scent based entirely on heavy basenotes, there's always the danger of it turning into a lead balloon, but that's been avoided here thanks to use of a bright, grassy vetiver and the lemony smoke of elemi resin, both of which keep the composition aerated. The smoky chypric finish of whiskey-ish labdanum and bitter oakmoss confirms Patchouli Oud as the perfect choice for the gentleman daring enough to pull off an oud scent alongside a perfectly tailored three-piece suit."," Oud, patchouli, vetiver, cistus, elemi, incense, gaiac, tree moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Musc Ambre Gris Eau de Parfum,1642,Affinessence Paris," Ambergris, the precious sperm whale excretion that's aged for years by the ocean, is the purest essence of the sea. It's an unusual material in perfumery because although it derives from an animal and retains a distinctly animalic character, it also smells mineral, earthy, ozonic, and foresty. In fact, one could say that the scent of ambergris is a microcosm of nature's bounty in full. Ambergris is something of a shapeshifter in perfumery, though – it's suggestible. In Musc Ambre Gris, the perfumer has nudged the natural ambergris towards a saltier, woodsier interpretation than some of the sweeter, more amber-focused compositions in the genre. What's striking about this fragrance is that it smells completely organic, as if it were ripped from nature and not made in a lab. It encompasses all the wind-chafed aromas of a desolate beach in winter, ranging from desiccated driftwood, crushed seashells, and minerals to the inky bitterness of marine lichen. Musc Ambre Gris smells vivid and wild, its smoky tangle of sea grasses (vetiver), yerba mate, and sharp black musk with its creosote-like tang all pulling together to emphasize the raspy, masculine-leaning character of the scent. In the far drydown, earthy patchouli and white truffle add a fungal depth that accentuates the salt-flat brininess of the ambergris. A perfume of scorched earth, Musc Ambre Gris has the brooding intensity of a young Brando- not to mention the undeniable seductiveness."," Amber gris, black musk, white truffle, yerba mate, patchouli, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Cuir Curcuma Eau de Parfum,2704,Affinessence Paris," The first fragrance in the world to use natural extract of turmeric, Cuir Curcuma is a strikingly different kind of leather fragrance. Neither a Russian nor a Spanish (Moorish) leather, but rather, an Indian leather, it rises like a phoenix from the clay attar stills and tanning yards of Kannauj, where ancient ayurvedic principles of balance in all things still reigns supreme. Cuir Curcuma is fine leather cured with lots of earthy golden spice and hot milk, for a result that's unusual enough to be distinctive but delicious enough to be comforting.  Cuir Curcuma cleverly plays on the theme of a traditional Indian drink called Golden Milk, an ayurvedic tonic taken in India to cleanse the bloodstream and balance all doshas. This golden elixir balances the iodic bitterness of turmeric with the sweet creaminess of whole milk, pulverized almonds, sugar, and pistachios. You'll find that the same push-pull between“eat me” and“don't eat me” carried through to the fragrance itself. The crazy-delicious lactones thrown off by the sandalwood create a“steamed milk” effect similar to the one in Santal Basmati, but here it is spicier - woods cooked down with resin until the bottom layer catches and caramelizes. It smells incredibly tasty, but also tasteful, a sprinkle of salty, anisic myrrh stopping the scent from straying too far into gourmandise. Cuir Curcuma is a scent full of drama, its inky medicinal notes making you sit up and take notice. Sweepingly exotic, yet seductively cozy, this is the leather jacket you never thought you could pull off, and now can't live without."," Turmeric, myrrh, sandalwood, patchouli, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hwyl Eau de Parfum,2794,Aesop," Smoky, woodsy, completely compelling, Hwyl is an explorer's journey into the heart of the eternal forest as only Aesop could present it. Combining gorgeously smooth cedarwood and seductively sexy incense- lovers of CDG Hinoki and Incense Kyoto should clear a spot on the shelf right now- Hwyl adds an intriguing element of depth with an intense base of vetiver that showcases grassy and spicy facets with equal aplomb. It's a fragrance that feels both natural and supernatural, as if one is in tune with the deeper secrets of an ancient wood- and yet, that sense of peace and wisdom coexists perfectly with an undeniable sensuality- this is sexy, smoky incense the likes of which we haven't encountered in a while. Get lost in the forest with Hwyl- you'll be glad you did."," Cypress, frankincense, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30155.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Tempo Eau de Parfum,2137,Diptyque," All too often,  patchouli scents seem to be apologizing for their star ingredient. ""It's patchouli, "" the refrain goes,  ""but it's not hippie patchouli."" Tempo,  the wonderful new patchouli scent from Diptyque,  defies such simple-minded rejection- after all,  it's explicitly inspired by 60's counterculture- but those fearing unbearably thick earthiness and lack of nuance will surely be delighted by Tempo's complex,  gorgeous subtlety,  which weds three distinct types of patchouli to a perfectly balanced mix of mate and violet,  delivering a scent both unapologetically patchouli-driven,  yet undeniably sophisticated.By building around a carefully calibrated mix of three sustainably-sourced,  ethically-harvested varieties of Indonesian patchouli,  Olivier Pescheux delivers a patchouli accord that celebrates all facets of the material: earthy,  woodsy,  spicy and sweet,  all balanced against one another with subtle elegance. This careful balance is further enhanced with lively,  green violet leaf and nutty,  spicy mate,  which serve to remove even the tiniest edges from the scent- the patchouli washes over you so gently that it's hard to even remember why it would ever be considered a divisive ingredient. Even if you long ago traded in your bell bottoms for designer jeans,  give Tempo a chance- you may never think of patchouli the same way again."," Bergamot, pink pepper, patchouli, mate, clary sage, violet leaf",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483030.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fleur de Peau Eau de Parfum,1664,Diptyque," As part of Diptyque's 50th anniversary celebration, Fleur de Peau is meant to turn back the clock to the 1960's, and one of the counterculture's most beloved scents- musk. Warm, sweet, and deeply sensual, the musk oils of the 60's were more powerful than subtle, so how then to update that classic feeling for today's grown-up, yet nostalgic, audience? By wedding a gorgeous bouquet of various musks to a beautiful, iris-driven floral heart, Fleur de Peau has us in awe of its sophisticated, subtle, musky perfection.The musks at the core of Fleur de Peau are, simply put, heavenly- a divine combination of notes both cotton-soft and rich, light and soapy-given an extra element of sparkle with a perfect amount of aldehydes. A beautiful iris note- a bit powder, a bit paper, a touch of woodsy earth, but primarily clean- blends with fruity, gently ambery ambrette seed, and ambergris further extends a rich, mineralic tone that deepens the musks without displacing them. All together, it creates a skin scent with every bit as much complexity as a towering oriental, the kind of fragrance that will bring you back to your wrist countless times over the scent's impressive lifespan. It's a trip both forwards and backwards in time, a scent that celebrates the past with the sophistication of the future- and really, what could be more perfect for Diptyque's 50th anniversary? Musk lovers- your perfect skin scent has arrived."," Aldehydes, pink pepper, rose, iris, ambrette, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483031.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lost In Flowers Eau de Parfum,1662,Strangelove NYC," If you've ever tried out a bunch of floral perfumes and said to yourself, nope, just not floral enough, then let us introduce you to Lost in Flowers. Remember the scene from American Beauty when the cheerleader lying in the bath was showered with rose petals? Well, replace the roses with champaca, muguet, and gardenia petals, and that's what wearing Lost in Flowers feels like. Most aptly named, Lost in Flowers is a sublime experience akin to submerging oneself in a warm bath of heady, fragrant, life-giving flowers.   Called joy oil in India, the rare red champaca otto used in Lost in Flowers casts a strange, unearthly glow over the composition. It at first smells innocent, like fruit dipped in cream and wrapped in a clean, juicy shampoo aura. But then it is also smells musky and honeyed, in a way that's more suggestive of intimacy. What dominates, for us, however, is the exquisite gardenia enfleurage, a costly and rare extraction that yields the only true portrait of gardenia that exists in perfumery. Gardenia lovers take note – this is Holy Grail material: creamy, salty, and with a bodacious meatiness that's soulful without ever tripping over into bleu cheese territory. The astringent pop of saffron adds an undertone of leather and iodine, the tagetes a pungent, hay-like facet – colorful touches of Indian attar perfumery in an otherwise tropical picture. Thanks to these spicy, woody touches, and to the salinity of the gardenia, Lost in Flowers never runs sweet or syrupy. It's not even overtly feminine in the traditional sense. In other words, men – knock yourselves out with this one. It's a stunner, no matter which way you slice it."," Indian red champaca oil, lily of the valley, tagetes (marigold), saffron, gardenia enfleurage, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Lost In Flowers Oil Perfume Oil,2176,Strangelove NYC," If you've ever tried out a bunch of floral perfumes and said to yourself, nope, just not floral enough, then let us introduce you to Lost in Flowers.

Dead of Night Eau de Parfum,2357,Strangelove NYC," Dead of Night is an oil-based fragrance featuring organic oud oil distilled from agarwood trees grown on a sustainably-managed 600-acre plantation in Borneo. It's the equivalent of the Slow Food movement, only in oud terms – no chemical inoculation, no rubbery oud aromachemicals, and little interference from humans. This slow way of farming agarwood produces oud oil that is authentically pungent at first, but quickly softens to reveal the supple, tangy aroma of lambskin freshly cured with hay, herbs, and tea. Polished and set in the frame of a fragrance composition like a jewel, a material like this oud shines. Just keep in mind that this is indeed real oud. Those with little to no experience of oud outside of commercial perfumery might be taken aback at how animalistic and raw the note appears at first, but fear not! In time, the fearsome braggadocio of the opening relaxes into a wonderful aroma of soft leather, delicately sour with accents of dried apricots and fermented tea. Violet leaf and bergamot add freshness to the composition, the crushed greenery and citrus notes mimicking the minty sparkle of agarwood grown on the island of Borneo. The florals are subtly placed so as not to distract from the golden, glowing oud, but a glimpse of rose and jasmine emerges in the heart to sweeten its hay-like tone. Subtle brushstrokes of sandalwood and incense help the oud to fade out gently at the end, but, like a theater star, it lingers for hours on stage, in full knowledge that it's what people really came to see."," Bergamot, violet leaf, jasmine, rose, amber, sandalwood, incense, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Silence the Sea Eau de Parfum,2092,Strangelove NYC," Silence the Sea is the true essence of the sea. Forget the horrors of Calone and sweet aquatics – this scent captures all the stony, mineral silence of a deserted beach in winter. Because it is a brand deeply invested in organic, sustainable raw material production, Strangelove NYC was able to source an ethically-harvested (beach cast) piece of ambergris and use it as the star in this composition. And indeed, it is the strange, salty-sweet airiness of ambergris that dominates here. It floats at the center, emanating an aura of fresh marine air, earth, dried newspapers, tobacco, and even the warm funk of a freshly-cleaned horse stable. Ambergris is, in short, the salty, yeasty smell of a child's head after hours of playing on a cold beach. Cleverly, the perfumer has chosen to not overshadow the ambergris but simply flank its already-complex smell with a host of complimentary“flavors”, such as the minty bitterness of angelica, the earthy funk of truffle, and the vegetal, rubbery texture of tuberose. These notes play a valiant second fiddle to the ambergris, emphasizing its flinty, mineral sweetness and extending its unearthly radiance in all directions. Those who love the mysterious, almost indefinable smell of the salt air on a cold beach will adore Silence the Sea."," ambergris, oud, tuber, jasmine, tuberose, angelica",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79304.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Melt my Heart Eau de Parfum,1460,Strangelove NYC," A gourmand lover's dream, but really so much more than just a delicious smell, Melt My Heart is an oil-based fragrance that captures the dizzying sensation of falling in love. And if you imagine that to feel like falling slowly backwards into a featherbed filled with fluffy orris butter and dark chocolate, well, then your vision lines right up with that of Strangelove NYC. Creamy, soft, and utterly addictive, this scent combines the mouthfeel of powdered white chocolate and lipstick with the velvety bitterness of 85% cocoa.   Real orris butter, costlier than most other perfumery materials and described by Chandler Burr as“liquid good taste”, has been used generously here to give the more edible elements spaciousness and lift, like a puff of silvery breath on the cold air. It is the“white” element that contrasts so effectively with the dulcet bitterness of the dark chocolate note. Real oud, ginger, and mandarin are just present enough to draw out various facets of the chocolate and the iris – a spicy, woodsy undertone perhaps - but don't expect too dominant a presence. The sandalwood, in comparison, is a real MVP in this composition, its lush, buttered, coconutty sweetness playing off the dark chocolate and orris to create a delicious Mounds Bar accord that will make you want to nibble your arm. The perfumer, Christophe Laudamiel, says that Melt My Heart is“for falling in love.” Well, we can't imagine anyone smelling this and not being helplessly in its thrall."," ginger, bergamot, nutmeg, sage, oud, dark chocolate, orris root",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79306.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Be Careful What You Wish For Parfum Extrait,1561,4160 Tuesdays," An oud scent from 4160 Tuesdays? We didn't think it would ever happen, mostly because Sarah herself said it probably wouldn't. After all, with so many companies shoving one oud after another out to market, doing an oud just to do it wouldn't really seem to be on-brand for a perfumer who is forging a wonderful career out of following her own inspirations. But a fateful trip to Dubai left Sarah with some truly exquisite specimens of agarwood extract and, for the first time, she felt the call. So, how to make an oud scent that's also, first and foremost, a 4160 Tuesdays scent? One sniff and the answer is clear. Be Careful What You Wish for is by far the juiciest, fruitiest, most delectably fresh oud we've ever smelled. Energized with tantalizingly tart citrus and shot through with sweet peach, this scent still manages to be as deep, woody and captivating as you could hope for. Five types of real oud will do that, but the balance against the fruit strikes a joyous major chord, while the typical funk of decaying wood is replaced with a grand richness that lasts for untold hours. As tongue-in-cheek as the name may be, if you were wishing for an oud scent that breaks free of convention and exudes real, authentic happiness, 4160 Tuesdays is here to deliver."," Pink grapefruit, juniper berry, peach, white oudh, raspberry, strawberry, gaiac, patchouli, vanilla, plum, dark oudh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64624.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Carlisle Eau de Parfum,1832,Parfums de Marly," Christened from a majestic 17th-century English steed, Carlisle is a warmly spiced, gourmand-inflected oriental reserved only for the bold. Opening with a colorful burst of juicy, tart green apple spiked with fiery saffron and earthy nutmeg, Carlisle immediately sets itself apart from even Marly's other wondrous gourmands with a grounded, sophisticated earthiness evident from the very first sniff- this is less indulgent dessert pudding and more the aromas of a grand ballroom soiree in full swing, mouthwatering treats mingled with well-groomed aristocracy, elaborate decor and the general spirit of revelry. A richer-yet heart reveals warm, smooth tonka bean and creamy osmanthus- but also gently bitter davana and luscious rose, leading into a true patchouli note that doesn't hold back on the earthiness. However, lovers of Herod and Oajan need not worry, either- alongside that earthy patchouli, a warmly emergent vein of creamy vanilla and sweet opoponax resinoid are every bit as enchantingly seductive as they are in Marly's other masterpieces. As they all reach an enduring harmony in Carlisle's final stages, the glow is enough to make you feel like you, yourself are descended from royalty."," Green apple, saffron, nutmeg, tonka bean, osmanthus, davana, rose, patchouli, vanilla, opoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70026.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

The patchouli, spliced with soft, asian-inspired incense and gentle musk, wafts in slowly, increasing in intensity with such deliberate patience that there's never an even fleeting moment of harshness- instead, it feels like a guided meditation, a journey to a place both beautifully unknown, yet comfortingly familiar. Whether you're a patchouli lover looking for something unique, or an agnostic yet to discover what patchouli is truly capable of, Patchouli Argent is a unique delight that will linger in your memory."," Bergamot, rose, jasmine, coriander, musk, incense, woody notes, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75721.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Bibliotheque Eau de Parfum,1122,BYREDO," Rare is the scent that is equally perfect for the home and the body alike, but Byredo's ultra-popular Bibliotheque candle, with its sophisticated blend of fruit, leather and vanilla, has long left its many fans clamoring for a wearable version. We're pleased to say the wait is now over- at least for a limited time. Bibliotheque opens with a mouthwatering burst of peach and plum, juicy and fresh but balanced with a controlled, gently powdery violet heart- rather than candy, it exudes the quiet sweetness of weathered book pages. A smooth, worn leather and crackling patchouli further the scent's evocation of a wood-walled study lined with first editions, a well-loved easy chair, a touch of vanilla conjuring a glass of excellent brandy on the side table. As a candle, it all came together to add evocative elegance to any room, but as an eau de parfum, it's much more versatile than that, the ideal complement to any style from boho chic to gala evening wear.

Impressions de Giverny Eau de Parfum,2250,Fort & Manle," Impressions de Giverny is a scentscape inspired by Monet's famous gardens at Giverny. The artist, who was as passionate about gardening as he was about art, wanted to turn his garden into a living“en plein air” version of his paintings, and so he did. The fragrance cleverly takes its cues from the two main areas of the Giverny garden: first, the famous Japanese water garden with its bridge and water lilies that feature in Monet's NymphÃ©as series, and second, the section where thousands of small flowers were planted to achieve the same blurred-at-the-edges, impressionistic effect espoused by his painting style. In other words, Impressions de Giverny takes its inspiration from two sources: Japanese botany and abstract floral perfumery. The way these two themes intersect is beautifully handled. The scent opens with a crisp, almost sour fruity tone, with zesty yuzu and red apple creating a delicate impression of native Japanese fruits and flora. But almost immediately you can sense the rugged, unpretentious greenery of shrubs and undergrowth shifting beneath, adding an earthy undertone. Threaded through these accords is an impressionistic swirl of flowers that's difficult to pick apart, but certainly combines the watery freshness of tulips and violet leaf with the denser, more honeyed aspects of magnolia, orange blossom, and osmanthus. There's a creamy warmth in the floral bouquet that feels great on the skin, underscored by subtle brushstrokes of mango, ylang, and peach. At the same time, it's also peppery and bright, thanks to flecks of lemony coriander and fig leaf that have been daubed on here and there for contrast. Finally, unlike many modern florals, there's a solid foundation here to keep it all afloat – a salty, musky ambergris and benzoin combo that not only shores up the florals but adds a touch of civety funk to the picture. We're just blown away by how perfectly the perfumer has combined all these minute brushstrokes of fruits, flowers, and greenery to come up with something that, despite being impressionistic and abstract in form, feels utterly coherent on the skin. If you loved Confessions of a Garden Gnome but fancy something less herbaceous and more fruity-floral, then make sampling Impressions de Giverny a priority."," Yuzu, bergamot, red apple, magnolia, rose, tuberose, osmanthus, orange blossom, fig leaf, coriander, tulip, neroli, mango, ylang, ambergris, benzoin, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78118.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

Parisian Oud Eau de Parfum,2483,Fragrance du Bois," What does pure luxury smell like? Of course, that's a question with more than one answer, but now that we've got our hands on Parisian Oud, we'd find it hard to imagine that anything could feel so sumptuous, so lush, so downright sophisticated as this wondrous combination of spice, florals, and a proprietary, organic oud extract so deep and rich that it makes our toes curl.With an opening gambit of cheerful spice provided by pink pepper and cardamom, Parisian Oud develops smartly with a top note of grapefruit, quietly tempered with subtle almond. The body opens into a medley of florals, rose essence, white jasmine, and geranium, before leather and Fragrance du Bois' 100% pure, natural oud builds the scent into a complex, sophisticated symphony. Cistus labdanum and frankincense then add rich, resinous notes to a base that evokes an almost ethereal smokiness, with sandalwood and patchouli easing the ensemble into a soft leather chair of a scent."," Pink pepper, cardamom, grapefruit, almond, rose essence, geranium, white jasmin, pure organic vintage oud, leather, frankincense, moss, labdanum, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75711.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fabulous Eau de Parfum,1272,TOM FORD Private Blend," Vulgar, shocking, rude, funny, tongue in cheek....no matter what you think of the name, there's no denying that it's got people talking. But in the kerfuffle over the name, has the fragrance itself been a bit overlooked? We think it might have been. The truth is that Fucking Fabulous is very good. It's an edible but fresh suede scent that borrows a bunch of bitter herbs from old school fougeres, scads of buttery tonka from the gourmand category, and wraps it all up in a musky cashmeran glow. And guess what? Totally works.  Clary sage and lavender top out the scent, their clean, smoky greenness meshing seamlessly with plush orris butter to form a leather note that's both soft and aromatic. Lashings of bittersweet almond and tonka bean beneath give the scent a velvety, almost oily-resinous sweetness, like white chocolate melted down with coffee grounds. The fragrance moves between bitter and sweet, herbal and creamy, powdery and oily over the course of the wear, keeping the journey totally interesting for us. Rumor has it that Tom Ford took one whiff of this creation and exclaimed,“This is fucking fabulous!” We're inclined to agree. Set your feelings aside for the name, take it out for a ride, and you may agree as well."," Lavender, clary sage, bitter almond, tonka bean, orris root, leather, cashmeran, amber, white woods Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Fabulous by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Black Gold Eau de Parfum,2594,Mancera," Bold, fresh, luxurious and sensual, Black Gold is a versatile masculine leather fragrance for today's renaissance man, the rare example of a scent equally comfortable on the beach, at the bar, or in the boardroom. Jump-started with an electric crackle of citrus and spice set against a smooth, compelling lavender, Black Gold soon develops a rich floral heart, kept masculine with the refreshing saltiness of oceanic notes and a perfectly balanced patchouli. And as it dries further, the leather- not too smoky, nor too soft, but with a quiet, confident ruggedness- takes control, lingering for untold hours at just the right volume to carry you from morning to evening, no matter the setting. A signature scent must balance versatility, sophistication, and that so-hard-to-define Wow Factor that can turn heads and make a special someone weak in the knees. After smelling Black Gold, we get the feeling more than a few modern men have just found a signature."," Citrus, oud, lavender, cinnamon, nutmeg, jasmine, violet, rose, sea notes, patchouli, vetiver, woody notes, leather, amber, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64932.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
AnOther 13 Eau de Parfum,1074,Le Labo," In 2010, Le Labo was commissioned by AnOther Magazine to work on an exclusive scent. This project was born thanks to Sarah Andelman, founder of the world famous Parisian boutique Colette.  Sarah initiated the creative collaboration between Le Labo and Jefferson Hack, editor-in-chief of AnOther Magazine. The result of this collaboration is AnOther 13, a hypnotizing and unique scent. It's composed of ambroxan, a synthetic musk, making AnOther 13 an addictive potion blended with twelve other ingredients such as jasmine, moss and ambrette seeds absolute - which gives it spike and shine. When news broke that Colette would forever close its doors in December 2017, we were lucky enough to welcome AnOther 13 into the permenant Le Labo collection.Personalize your fragrance:  Enter your custom message or name at checkout and we'll have Le Labo print it on your label.Please note: Complimentary samples available with any product purchase.

Vanille Fatale Eau de Parfum,2031,TOM FORD Private Blend," Tom Ford doesn't always do vanilla, but when he does, the results are never anything short of spectacular. Enter Vanille Fatale, a purring, prowling, seductively fanged new vanilla scent whose initial subtleties belie the dangerously glamorous depth within. Opening with a quiet but fiery growl of saffron and coriander, Vanille Fatale's mystery soon deepens as a smoky blend of myrrh and olibanum incense begin to cloud the room, draping themselves around a sweet floral bouquet and an increasingly creamy, sensuously full vanilla. As coffee and roasted barley bring a comforting, yet subtly edgy dose of warm and resinous character, a rich mahogany wood keeps everything in balance, providing enough robust unisex woodsiness to make this scent an easy recommendation for men and women alike. And for those of us who prefer a finely-sharpened blade to blunt force, Vanille Fatale is a sotto voce stunner, ideal for drawing the object of your seduction ever closer without shouting over the room. Think of it as the ultimate secret weapon- and deploy it accordingly."," Saffron, coriander, frangipani, narcissus, coffee absolute, mahogany, roasted barley, vanilla, myrhh, olibanum Click Here For Ingredients Ã—Close Vanille Fatale by TOM FORD Private Blend Ingredients Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

Tsuki Eau de Parfum,2567,Di Ser," Tsuki, meaning“moon”, is a wild green scent that captures the thrilling unfamiliarity of Japanese herbs and aromatics. Imagine crushing the leaves of some strange herb between your fingers in the dark and not knowing what it is, exactly. The minty, rosy sting of geranium is clearly identifiable, but you also smell something like crushed lemon balm and coriander beneath that. The aroma is green, minty, herbaceous, citrusy, and also gin-like thanks to a generous dose of juniper berry. But perhaps the most defining feature here is the fresh, vegetal scent of fennel, which gives the background of the scent a lingering anisic sweetness.  Strangely enough, even if you've never been to Japan or smelled Japanese herbs and aromatics before, there is something that marks this scent out as clearly Japanese, rather than Chinese or Indian - possibly its sense of delicacy and restraint. After a bold start, the scent whittles down into a shadowy trace of powdered ginger and licorice root that, although not loud in volume, remains a gentling presence that calms and focuses the mind throughout the day. With its energizing and uplifting qualities, Tsuki is truly a health tonic in scent form: we can imagine it being doled out in therapeutic doses by doctors to tired, stressed-out patients. Detox from the noise of modern life with this wonderful little elixir."," Geranium, grapefruit, coriander, basil, lemon, fennel, juniper, spicy mint, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
"Feb. 14, 1912 Eau de Parfum",2921,Rundholz Parfums," Warm and cool, sharp and milky, rooty and bright, Feb.14, 1912 is a study in rich contrasts. Opening with a rich, bittersweet burst of citrus cut with deep aromatic notes of star anise, fennel, and licorice, the scent soon reveals a deep, rich iris note, waxy, rooty and so smoothly earthy as to almost be papyrus-like. A distinctive milk note softens the dryness of the florals, adding comfort and contrast. And in place of the incense that makes up the backbone of most Rundholz fragrances, here a distinguished, balsamic leather note plays that part, bridging the gap between the spicy, the creamy, the musky and the floral. Refined and understated, yet complex and deeply resonant, Feb.14, 1912 is unmistakably a Rundholz creation- and also unlike anything they've offered before."," Orange, bergamot, star anise, fennel, licorice, milk, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang ylang, heliotrope, carnation, carrot seed, cedar, white musk, leather, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Sasora Parfum,2036,Di Ser," Sasora, like all other fragrances in the Di Ser range, is 100% all natural, and features the finest absolutes and essences available in the world. Sasora is named for one of the 6 fragrant types of aloeswood (agarwood) traditionally used in the Kodo ceremony, the art of“listening” to Japanese incense: sasora, kyara, manaban, rakoku, sumontara, and managa. Cool and sour, sasora is thought to be equivalent to the first and finest batches of wild Hindi oud brought out of the jungles of Assam, in Northern India, and distilled exclusively for the use by the royal families of the Arabian Peninsula. The sasora oud oil used in this fragrance is 100% pure and of the highest quality available. Its scent profile boasts a monastic purity that reminds some of kyara, especially in the first few moments when it is heated over ash and mica plates as incense. However, the main characteristic of sasora is a herbal sourness, and it is this quality that has been accentuated in Sasora, the perfume.The citrusy brightness of yuzu is first to buzz the palate, cleansing the mind of all clutter and preparing the way for a Zen-like state of bliss. The citrus is followed by the biting greenness of camphor and the medicinal, lavender-like properties of spikenard, a herb grown high in the Himalayas. Both camphor and spikenard are beloved notes in Japanese culture, representing the herbaceous bitterness of snow-covered herbs and moss in a Japanese forest. Considered spiritually cleansing as well as elevating, these materials are typically used to flank aloeswood in traditional Japanese incense sticks. And indeed, Sasora does smell like the finest aloeswood incense from Shoyeido and Baieido – herbal, bittersweet, spicy, and medicinal at first, with a silky finish of sweet, powdered woods. The rosewood truly shines here, framing the precious oud oil and spikenard against a spicy, aromatic backdrop of rosin and the interior of a hand-carved musical instrument. Real oud oil from noble Assamese stock, stripped of its leathery animalism and polished to a high shine with herbs, aromatics, and yuzu – this might be the first oud fragrance we're tempted to wear in hot weather or even to the office."," Yuzu, agarwood, camphor, jatamansi (spikenard), palisander rosewood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Kyara Parfum,2739,Di Ser," Japanese treatment of agarwood in perfumery is completely different from that of Middle-Eastern perfumery, so let's take a minute to re-set expectations. Since the 6th century AD, the Japanese have used kyara agarwood in the Kodo ceremony (the way of incense), which is the art of“listening” to scent. Kyara is a very special type of agarwood. It refers to wood from extremely old, wild-grown agarwood trees in mostly Vietnam, now rare to the point of being extinct. The word“kyara” is a description of a scent profile, but also used in grading to mean the highest quality of agarwood. Most authentic kyara pieces were sold to private collectors in Japan, which is how Di Ser came into possession of its own small collection of the precious wood. Kyara is normally heated gently over ash and mica plates as incense; due to its rarity and scarcity, it is never used for distilling oud oil. Until now, that is. In an unprecedented move, Di Ser took the decision to distill oil from its own private collection of kyara. This was an enormously bold and risky undertaking, considering the expense of the raw material, the tiny yield, and the difficulty in extracting oil from such densely-resinated wood. Most oud oil fanatics will never have smelled genuine kyara, either in oil or incense form, so this fragrance, Kyara, is literally the opportunity of a lifetime. The holy grail of oud.  Kyara has a uniquely resinous, green aroma when burned, said to be calming and transporting in equal measure. The opening notes of this 100% natural fragrance are, in fact, pure kyara – verdant, minty, and slightly antiseptic, with the evergreen sting of camphor. Although recognizably oud, the note is as vaporous and clean as early morning mist in a Japanese forest -never dirty or smoky. A massive, gauzy rose note swells up behind the green kyara opening, fleshing out the kyara into a luminous rose-oud concerto against a spicy-woody backdrop that feels like powdered ginger root diffused in sunlight. In keeping with the Japanese classification of oud as rokkoku gomi (meaning ""of six countries"" and the bitter taste from“the five tastes of sweet, bitter, sour, pungent and salty”), the sweetness and powder is kept in check by the peppery, balsamic-vinegar underbite typical of Vietnamese agarwood. If you've grown weary of oud or simply dislike the more animalic, Arabic treatment of the material, then re-set your nose and give yourself a treat with Kyara, the Japanese silk screen of the oud world. Di Ser's Kyara represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to smell authentic kyara agarwood in liquid form – do not cheat yourself of this experience!"," Kyara grade agarwood, cedarwood, rose otto, patchouli, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Hasunoito Parfum,2092,Di Ser," Hasunoito is based on the lotus flower, the symbol of Di Ser and revered throughout Japan, India, and most Eastern Asian countries for its spiritual significance. The oil of both white and pink lotus is so costly and rare that Di Ser has chosen to focus mostly on the abstract idea of a lotus blossom shooting up through the soil, displaying the duality of strength and softness so characteristic of the flower.  And indeed, the first half of the perfume puts forth a convincing portrait of earth. The specific type of agarwood used here smells like cold, damp clay, with a fuzzy golden haze of something medicinal, like flowers dipped into an antiseptic ointment. Boronia absolute, used only in the most luxurious of all-natural perfumery, lends a fresh, spicy-fruity accent, like purple berries doused in wintergreen and clove. Despite the presence of lotus, rose, ylang, and jasmine, nothing about this perfume reads as floral in tone; rather, it smells like a pleasantly earthy, spicy tea filtered through hospital gauze. Arresting, different, and ultimately kind of addictive, Hasunoito is for people who wish to access higher planes of spirituality without going through the more hackneyed route of incense and flowers."," Agarwood (oud), sweet orange, boronia, ylang-ylang, jasmine sambac, lotus, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Akanesasu Eau de Parfum,2802,Di Ser," Akane sasu sora,  a wonderfully evocative phrase used in traditional Japanese poetry to express the vivid red glow of a particularly beautiful sunset. It's a phrase imbued with splendor,  suggesting that there are unique moments where the natural world drifts especially close to the supernatural realm,  with awe-inspiring results. To be certain,  a fragrance that draws on this lovely imagery must contain the same power,  the same energy,  the same reverence. Luckily,  this eye-openingly bright,  joyous and rich ode to citrus,  jasmine and vetiver is every bit as compelling as its namesake. As if to mirror the color progression of a sunset,  Akanesasu opens with a vivid burst of orange and bergamot,  where intense green coexists with the warm orange of juicy citrus fruit,  mouthwatering and energizing. A rich,  fresh jasmine heart (nothing heady or indolic here) positively glows with quiet majesty,  and an emergent vetiver base eschews the spikier side of the note in favor of gently woodsy warmth,  leaving you with the contented relaxation one feels as the sun dips behind the mountains,  leaving the sky painted red. A fragrance for summer sunsets and moments of appreciation,  Akanesasu is poetry in a bottle."," Orange, Bergamot, Jasmine sambac, Vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78805.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Shiragoromo Parfum,1508,Di Ser," Shiragoromo is an amalgamation of two words, shira (meaning white) and goromo (meaning cloth). White is a sacred color in Japan, even appearing as the main color on the Japanese flag, because it stands for purity and childlike innocence. The fragrance itself also smells clean and pure. Predominantly a simple, natural blend of bright yuzu and earthy green woods, Shiragoromo manages to give the feel of a sun-dappled citrus grove that is nonetheless clearly a Japanese citrus grove.  The opening is both sweet and medicinal - oranges and yuzu with the antiseptic bitterness of green aloeswood lurking directly beneath. The purity of the Di Ser approach to perfumery shines through strongly here and great thought has been given to the balance of all five taste elements of Japanese culture: sweet, bitter, sour, pungent and salty. It takes a long time for the floral elements to break free of the grip of medicinal yuzu and earthy woods, but finally a clean, radiant white jasmine steps out into the clearing. That the flower feels like an extension of the citrus and woods is testament to both the skill of the perfumer and the delicacy of the jasmine oil used here. If you like the idea of white flower petals filtered through damp, earthy green woods and exuberant citrus, then look to Shiragoromo. It's the rare white floral that doesn't actually behave or smell like one; glimpsed at an oblique angle and shaped into something new by the other materials, Shiragoromo feels like a fresh take on a much-traveled theme."," Agarwood, yuzu, jasmine sambac, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Suleyman le Magnifique Eau de Parfum,2964,Fort & Manle," The longest-reigning sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Suleyman I presided over the empire's golden age, marked by massive conquest and expansion, cutting edge political and societal reform, and some of the world's greatest artistic and cultural output- to say nothing of his legendary, passionate love for his wife Roxelana, elevated from his harem to be his queen in bold defiance of tradition and convention. This is the man Rasei Fort pays tribute to with Suleyman le Magnifique, a fragrance that celebrates the Sultan's dynamic complexity by blending notes both softly sweet and ferociously animalic. An amalgamation of florals, spice, incense and resin, it's a powerfully irresistible ode to the opulence of an illustrious empire, contrasting bitter-green galbanum against syrupy amber, earthy patchouli with juicy red apple and fiery cinnamon, all against a backdrop of deep, animalic oud. Luxurious, sumptuous and sophisticated, Suleyman le Magnifique is a truly fitting homage to one of history's great figures."," Galbanum, amber, musk, benzoin, patchouli, vetiver, oud, sandalwood, rose, tuberose, vanilla, ambergris, cinnamon, red apple",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Charlatan Eau de Parfum,2228,Fort & Manle," From our very first encounter, Fort & Manle has blown us away with their ability to tell wonderfully targeted stories with their scents- tales where the fragrances themselves go far beyond ""matching the mood"" of the copy and become genuine narratives in their own right. Charlatan, a tale of seduction, deception, betrayal, and sin, is by these standards truly a masterwork. Opening with sweetly soft, romantic pear dipped in luscious chocolate, the opening notes evoke a gentle and charming courtship. Even as an element of carnality is introduced via black Perigord truffle, it builds into a passionate symphony of Damascene rose and a lush supporting floral cast, a flirtation exploded into a full-blown romance. Only as a deeply earthy amber and surprisingly spicy sandalwood enter the picture do we see the twist- an element of danger has saturated our storybook, and the elaborate bouquet may contain poison at the center. But then again, some lovers thrive on the edge. Sweet and soft, dark and dangerous, Charlatan is an incredibly creative scent that you'll enjoy experiencing as much as those around you."," Pear, chocolate, perigord truffle, rose, jasmine, osmanthus, vanilla bean, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Confessions of a Garden Gnome Eau de Parfum,2250,Fort & Manle," One does not often consider the humble nobility of the garden gnome, and yet his stoicism in the face of the ever-changing seasons is, in its own way, quite beautiful. Confessions of a Garden Gnome pays tribute to this stalwart steward of your backyard, whisking us through a whimsically enchanting year's worth of weather in a single spray, an experience that proves to be as creative and delightful as any we've had in niche fragrance. Confessions opens in springtime, a crisp, green breeze of yuzu-inflected bergamot atop a dewey musk. Summertime warmth emerges in the pulpy sweetness of mango and the smooth floral greenness of lily of the valley and lush rose, while autumn beckons from around the corner with crackling cedarwood and salty ambergris. Ultimately, the darkening wood notes lead into winter, while glowing amber suggests the warmth and comfort lurking just out of reach of our heroic gnome, frozen as he is to his territory. It's a wonderful piece of craftsmanship, an ever-evolving fragrant experience that must be worn to be believed. Mister Gnome, we salute you."," Cedar, musk, Sicilian bergamot, coriander, yuzu, pink pepper, lily of the valley, mango, rose, violet leaf, ambergris, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78102.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Amber Absolutely Eau de Parfum,2557,Fort & Manle," Amber fragrances are often associated with warmth, comfort, and beauty- but can an amber be dangerous? In the hands of Rasei Fort- absolutely. Here, the dynamic new nose behind Fort & Manle envisions amber as a trap, a seduction, glowing so brightly that those drawn to its light cannot realize they've become the prey... until it's too late. Don't get us wrong- this is one of the most delicious, warm and downright rapturous ambers we've experienced- rich, resinous labdanum, spiked with benzoin, sweetened with a golden honey and juicy plum. But an unexpectedly striking note of rose manages to feel both lush and thorny, and raw, spicy vetiver splices with stout cedarwood to deliver a powerful bite when least expected. Amber lovers, you'll fall head over heels for this rich, creative and ferocious elixir. And those who normally shy away from dessert-sweet amber scents- maybe it's time to try an amber with some fangs."," Musk, amber, benzoin, labdanum, honey, plum, rose, vetiver, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Fatih Sultan Mehmed Eau de Parfum,2738,Fort & Manle," A tribute to the opulence and glory of the Ottoman Sultanic Empire, Fatih Sultan Mehmed is a grand fragrance indeed, well worthy of the outsized reputation of Mehmed the Conqueror. Crisp, juicy apple bursts off the skin from the very first spritz, while a heart of romantically smooth flowers- lush Damask rose and vibrant iris- balances expertly against gorgeously textured, gently spicy ambergris, keeping the floral heart both lively and unisex. Finally, a sumptuous drydown of woods, musks and resins further accentuates the lavish character of the scent, allowing the complexity of the ingredients to remain front and center while never feeling as heavy or spice-laden as your typical exotic oriental. Ambergris lovers, we recommend getting your hands on this scent today- put simply, Fatih Sultan Mehmed smells like a million bucks."," Bergamot, apple, petitgrain, rose, tulip, iris, vanilla bean, benzoin, amber, ambergris, cedar, patchouli, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Harem Rose Eau de Parfum,2760,Fort & Manle," A soliflore is a big test for a young perfume house- when the adornments of complicated genres and endless ingredient lists are stripped away, when the goal is to deliver one simple, beautiful floral, how will it deliver? With Harem Rose, a gorgeous rose soliflore with gently oriental elements, we have our answer. Yes, it's a rose scent, but not all roses are created equal, and the Damascene Rose that Rasei Fort presents here is ethereal, a lush but youthful pink rose floating on a wave of soothing musk, gentle vanilla and the slightest hint of earth and spice from a subdued vetiver. The result is substance without heaviness, a truly three dimensional rose without a single thorn, a fresh floral that sinks happily into cloudlike repose. If you love fresher, gentler roses but don't want to smell like a teenager, great news: Harem Rose beckons."," Amber, benzoin, vanilla, rose, cashmere woods, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Maduro Eau de Parfum,2155,Fort & Manle," In 1961, a Cuban cargo ship, the Reina del Mar, was intercepted by Barbadian pirates on its way to the United States. The ship was scuttled in the ocean and its cargo- tropical fruits and, more importantly, a crate of rare, priceless Cohiba Maduro cigars- sank to the bottom of the ocean. With Maduro, Fort & Manle reimagine the deep, intoxicating aroma of that cargo hold as an explosion of herbaceous spice, fruit, and rich tobacco, a smoky-sweet woody gourmand with unparalleled depth. Clean, vibrant fruit and spice collide with rich, resinous amber, earthy patchouli is smoothed with warm vanilla and woods, and at the center, an intriguingly complex tobacco- dry and spicy one moment, sweet and musty the next. The Reina del Mar may have shipwrecked, but Maduro, the fragrance it inspired, is a magnificent vessel indeed."," Basil, apple, pineapple, amber, tobacco, beeswax, cinnamon leaf, vanilla, patchouli, vetiver, benzoin, atlas cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Bojnokopff Eau de Parfum,1887,Fort & Manle," An extravagant homage to the showmanship of pre-revolution Russia's master illusionists, Bojnokopff (formerly titled Mr. Bojnokopff's Purple Hat) is itself a throwback- a sweet, smoky, darkly woodsy gourmand that defies characterization even as it enchants all who encounter it. Our grand illusion opens with a deep, dark oud note, pungent enough to avoid the dreaded ""medicinal"" tag but pleasantly balanced with wispy wood smoke and a complementary vein of smooth, clean French lavender. As the act progresses, the smoke pouring from our titular hat begins to thicken and billow, taking on the warm creaminess of vanilla and the indulgent richness of Belgian chocolate, simultaneously mouthwatering and, in harmony with the ever-present oud, seductively mysterious. As the smoke fills the stage, deep, spicy woodsiness prevails, with gaiac and cedar combining with an almost oily vetiver to delightful effect- when the smoke finally clears, only the hat itself remains on stage. Who is the mysterious Mr. Bojnokopff, and how can his magical fragrance be both deliciously gourmand and seductively woodsy all at once? Would you really want to spoil the illusion by finding out?"," Oud, lavender, vanilla, chocolate, vetiver, gaiac, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Slowdive Eau de Parfum,1382,Hiram Green Perfumes," Is the name of Hiram Green's latest all-natural stunner a reference to Slowdive, the seminal UK shoegaze band who recently made a triumphant return to recording after a two-decade absence? The perfumer's notes are vague, referencing only ""the mood of those languid afternoons when the sweetness of the Indian summer air is almost palpable."" But it's not like those two concepts are unrelated- after all, the best shoegaze music is a lot like that feeling Green describes- an intense, steady hum of warmth and light, almost embryonic in its soothing envelopment. This is the feeling of Slowdive, a richly honeyed bouquet of potent white florals, hazily syrupy and mouthwateringly sweet, with a spicy-floral tobacco blossom featured at the center. The result is a gloriously but carefully balanced overdrive of olfactive noise, a fuzz of ambered, resinous fruits, lush, narcotic florals and invigorating spice, and the newest example of Hiram Green's remarkable ability to make disarmingly complex natural fragrances without limitation. While the connection between fragrance and band remains (appropriately) blurry, we can't help but feel that they'd approve."," Neroli, orange flower, tobacco blossom, tuberose, honey, dried fruit, resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Baque Parfum Extrait,2558,Slumberhouse," We'd heard talk of Baque, a long-discontinued Slumberhouse original that pre-dated our relationship with Josh Lobb's tantalizing creations, but truth be told, we weren't too worried about it. How could a different Slumberhouse tobacco scent steal our hearts away from the mouthwatering fruit-laced smoking pipe of Kiste, or the smoky-sweet darkness of (dearly departed) Jeke? But now, Baque is, well, back, and we're delighted to discover that it's a dynamic, vividly-painted tobacco scent that lands squarely in the middle of our two previous favorites. Combining syrupy, fruity apricot with sweet, spicy tobacco and a deep strain of boozy richness, Baque hypnotizes and delights, seduces and compels, and most importantly, draws us deep within an vivid, gorgeous imaginary landscape as only Slumberhouse can."," Apricot, cedar, straw, vanilla, tobacco leaf, davana, ambergris, parchment",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63111.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Camel Extrait de Parfum,1400,Zoologist," Camel is a series of elegant contradictions. Technically, it's an oriental, but in sidestepping all of the clichÃ©s of the genre, it retains a surprisingly brisk, fat-free mien. It features a plethora of rich, sticky notes like dates and dried fruit, but is as dry as a glass of champagne. Frankincense, musk, and oud lend a sinuous exoticism that speaks to the East; yet Camel has a distinctly retro flourish that places it firmly among the flanks of classic French perfumes such as My Sin and Arpege. We sense several shifting layers of scent in Camel, all of them fascinating. First, a topnote of dried fruit dipped in green frankincense sets the pace: resinous, rich, but also dry, tart almost. Imagine the steamy sweetness of dried apricots and plums laid out in a souk, pricked by the waxy sourness of preserved lemons and pickled mangoes just beneath. The mouthwatering notes of the opening give way to an animalic floral heart – a none-too-clean jasmine and orange blossom whipped into a soapy, leathery froth by civet and musk. All this is spread over a gritty amber drydown that manages to smell like the friction between hot sand, cold soap, and silk sheets. Although Camel strikes us as more Madame Bovary than Scheherazade, it nonetheless manages to capture the contradictory nature of the camel, itself permanently poised between froideur and rage."," Dried fruits, frankincense, palm date, rose, amber, cedar, cinnamon, incense, jasmine, myrrh, orange blossom, civet, musk, sandalwood, oud, tonka, vanilla, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Day Dreams Eau de Parfum,1285,Montale," Like the warm summer nights in Greece, where the daylight is endless and the air is ripe with flowers. Montale's whisper-soft Day Dreams is about what is left when all cares melt away. A juicy burst of mandarin opens up a romantic whirlwind of white flowers - neroli, jasmine, orange blossom - and a tropical hit of tiare. As it all floats along a fluffy cloud of vanilla and coconut, the sensual, musky fragrance proves its worth as truly a dream come true."," Orange blossom, jasmine, mandarin, neroli, tiare, sandalwood, vanilla, coconut",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35483.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Intense Black Aoud Extrait de Parfum,1141,Montale," Imagine the elegance of Black Aoud, with its perfect pairing of pert roses and mellow, woodsy oud and sandalwood base. Now take it up a notch in presence, sillage, and projection with Intense Black Aoud. It's like adding a harmonized chorus for a song - the precious Cambodian oud is magnified with rich, earthy Indonesian patchouli leaves and a hint of tart mandarine. The proud rose glides along the powerful musky woods for a warm, robust new take on the original masterpiece."," Rose petals, mandarine, aoud, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35481.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Arabians,2334,Montale," Arabians is about capturing that feeling of royal adventure, with wind in your hair and a lover by your side. Inspired by the King of the Desert, the Arabian Horse, this regal fragrance takes the classic fougÃ¨re and takes it for a musky, sensually spiced spin. Sweet clean lavender heads the way, accompanied by a sexy blend of cardamom, rose, warm patchouli, and the most subtle use of oud by Montale we've seen yet. The result is stunningly seductive - an elegant leathery fougÃ¨re that dares you to lean in and come along for a mysterious ride."," Lavender, leather, red thyme, cardamom, patchouli, Malaysian aoud, vetiver, rose, amber, animal musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35482.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
Ummagumma Eau de Parfum,1435,Bruno Fazzolari," As a multi-sensory artist, Bruno Fazzolari's creations pulse with the energy of magical realms, from the blazing glow of Feu Secret to the crackling fluorescents of Room 237. But with Ummagumma, Fazzolari ushers us into his darkest, sultriest locale yet- a languorous world of rich gourmand notes that flow with indulgently deliberate sweetness- aromatic, smooth tobacco, resinous labdanum, creamy vanilla and sandalwood- and foremost of all, a mouthwateringly warm, rich chocolate note, sweet and robust without a drop of fake sugar. This is an adult gourmand, a scent to be savored, evocatively sexy on men or women, young or old. Perhaps it's not right to call it a gourmand at all- it's a portal to yet another world that defies too-simple categorization while at the same time feeling immeasurably appropriate for the one category it firmly falls into- that of an original Bruno Fazzolari creation. Chocolate lovers, winter adventurers, and all who appreciate original art- don't miss Ummagumma."," Saffron, carnation, chocolate, tobacco, leather, labdanum, sandalwood, cedar, frankincense, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69309.jpg?width=400&404=product.png
